      "In a major retreat on Friday, the federal government withdrew controversial amendments to its gun-control bill. The now-removed changes would have cemented bans on thousands of assault-style firearms, but had been widely criticized for also targeting guns used by hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said his government would try to refine and reintroduce the prohibitions on assault-style guns – a move for which the Bloc Québécois signalled its support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberal House Leader Mark Holland wouldn’t say whether the aim was for that to be done through a new round of amendments to the bill, known as C-21, or through an entirely new law.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We didn’t get it right,” Mr. Holland told reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amendments, which expanded the scope of Bill C-21 beyond its original focus on handguns, were tabled by the Liberals late in the parliamentary process, without explanation. The changes angered such a wide swath of Canadians, including First Nations leaders and premiers, that the minority government lost the support it needed from the NDP and Bloc Québécois to pass the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Friday withdrawal of the amendments was formalized at the Commons public safety committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes “really derailed” progress on the bill, NDP MP Alistair MacGregor told fellow committee members. “I’ve never seen such a groundswell of opposition come really from everywhere, all at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a news conference, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre took credit for the government’s reversal, saying his party had forced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “into a temporary but humiliating climbdown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trudeau and his ministers had staunchly defended the amendments, which would have legislated a prohibition on thousands of assault-style firearms and established a legal definition of guns to be banned automatically in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November and December, the Prime Minister blamed the widespread opposition, in part, on disinformation from the Conservatives, who he said were attempting to “scare everyone as much as possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trudeau first denied that the prohibitions would affect guns used for hunting, and then late in December acknowledged to CTV News that the government amendments would “take away” some hunting guns that are “too dangerous in other contexts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, Mr. Holland reversed the government’s message yet again. “We are committed to not affecting hunting,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the government withdrew the amendments because it failed to properly draw the line between guns legally used for hunting and those that are used in mass killings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We acknowledge and regret that the consultations that we undertook were not sufficient, and that there were gaps and problems in the amendments. That’s why we’ve retracted them,” Mr. Holland said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amendments had strong support from gun-control groups, in part because they would have made it more difficult for a future government to reverse existing bans on assault-style weapons, which are currently enacted through regulations, rather than legislation. Those bans cover guns used in mass shootings such as the 1989 mass murder of 14 women at École Polytechnique in Montreal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement Friday, Nathalie Provost, a spokesperson for the gun-control advocacy organization PolySeSouvient, established in the aftermath of that mass murder, said the group was shocked and dismayed by the government’s decision, but that it is still hopeful the amendments can be reintroduced after more consultation and revision.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The government needs only one opposition party to deliver on their promise to ban assault weapons and it would be unthinkable for the Bloc not to collaborate in this regard,” Ms. Provost said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill C-21 was introduced in May, 2022, just days after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex. The legislation was designed to freeze the sale of handguns, crack down on gun smuggling and automatically revoke firearms licences from domestic abusers. Advocates who had criticized Mr. Trudeau for not delivering on promises to enact stronger gun control welcomed the bill as the first substantive move in a generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Nov. 22, after witness testimony on Bill C-21 before the public safety committee had wrapped, the government tacked on the amendments, which expanded the bill to cover assault-style firearms. The changes were introduced by Liberal MP Paul Chiang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amendments were introduced in two sections. The first was a list of thousands of banned firearms. It also listed exceptions to the bans.\n",
      "\n",
      "That list primarily moved bans on firearms already done through regulation into legislation, but also added 482 more guns to the prohibition. The second section included language that would have automatically banned future weapons before they came on the market, if they were assault-style firearms as defined by the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government did not explain the amendments to the public when they were first introduced. Mr. Mendicino’s office later said the government had consulted three gun-control groups on the changes, but no hunting or gun-rights groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod Giltaca, chief executive and executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, said in an interview that his organization is “very pleased at this retreat by the Liberals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling the amendments’ withdrawal a “small but meaningful victory,” Mr. Giltaca said the organization remains concerned about how the government will approach gun control in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement Friday, Mr. Mendicino said the government will work with opposition parties to “craft a clear solution that will keep assault-style weapons off our streets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloc MP Kristina Michaud said in a statement that withdrawing the amendments was the right call. But she urged the government to try again and “do more” to prohibit assault-style weapons while respecting the rights of hunters. She said the focus should be on establishing a definition of what constitutes an assault-style weapon, rather than banning individual gun models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. MacGregor told reporters Friday that he would reserve judgment on any new attempt from the government to revive its legislated assault-style weapons ban. He said he believes that the initial amendments fell outside the scope of Bill C-21.\n"

      "\n",
      "In the last few years, Frank Giralico, a sales representative for Capital North Realty, was doing a brisk trade in the Greater Toronto Area’s “preconstruction assignment market,” in which investors ante up a down-payment on an as-yet unbuilt condo and then flip the rights to purchase it for a profit before the unit is constructed, never actually intending to own it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That market hums along when prices are going up, and seizes up when they’re coming down, or when interest rates have spiked. “I focused a lot of my business on that because the market was geared that way,” he admits. Things are different now: “I’ve seen investors who are now faced with the reality that they’re either going to have to come up with extra funds because the mortgage rate has increased so much that they may not be able to close.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The frothy trade in preconstruction assignments drove the near record growth of the condo sector in 2021, and its collapse has contributed to its abrupt down-shifting in recent months, with Urbanation reporting a 79-per-cent decline in new sales in Q3 2021. As one of the many Youtube real estate investing channels recently noted in an hour-long post-mortem featuring @Precondo founder Jordan Scrinko, Pre-Construction Assignment Sales Are DEAD In Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons aren’t especially difficult to fathom. Intent on breaking the back of the inflation that’s stream-rollered the economy, the Bank of Canada’s aggressive rate hikes have made it much more difficult for buyers to prequalify for loans and, in some cases, come up with adequate funds to close a deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are other drivers at work, too – a series of federal and municipal policies, several of which came into force on Jan. 1, 2023, that are designed to throw even more cold water on the housing market and its eye-popping prices. These include:\n",
      "\n",
      "New anti-flipping rules, which taxes 100 per cent of the capital gains on a property sold within 365 days of purchase;\n",
      "\n",
      "The City of Toronto’s vacant home tax, which takes effect Feb. 3 and imposes a tax of 1 per cent of market value on unoccupied homes that don’t qualify for exemptions (see sidebar);\n",
      "\n",
      "A two-year moratorium on the purchase of residential real estate by foreign buyers;\n",
      "\n",
      "New Canada Revenue Agency rules requiring investors and speculators to pay HST on profits from preconstruction assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "These regulations layer onto several earlier measures – e.g., B.C.’s speculation and vacant homes tax and Ontario’s foreign home buyers tax – that also sought to take some of the steam out of the market at a time when governments across the country are looking for ways to stoke the construction of new homes and affordable apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other jurisdictions have tried similar measures to take the energy out of their own properties markets: New York State passed an anti-flipping law a decade ago. California last year passed a similar law, imposing a 25-per-cent tax on homes resold within three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the question of whether such policies or the Bank of Canada’s interest rate hikes succeeded in cooling the market is largely academic, there’s not much compelling evidence that anti-speculation laws have a significant impact on prices or availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murtaza Haider, who studies real estate management at Toronto Metropolitan University, says the data on B.C.’s vacant home tax shows only a modest effect, and doesn’t expect that Toronto’s new vacant homes policy will free up a lot of empty dwellings. “It doesn’t mean tens of thousands of new units will be available.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Olaf Weber, a University of Waterloo scholar who has studied such measures, adds that these moves “[show] that the government tries to do something. Many [people] will agree that international investors drive prices up. That’s a pretty simple narrative.” But, he adds, “I don’t think it will really change the market and create more affordable housing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Others, however, argue that the recent spate of policies haven’t gone far enough. Planner Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program, observes that the federal government’s new anti-flipping rule doesn’t apply to one of the most intensely speculative sectors, which is preconstruction assignments by foreign investors. Still, Mr. Yan adds, the growing list of restrictions and taxes is beginning to look like a systemic response to a housing crisis which he describes is 30 years in the making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether or not these measures succeed in tamping down speculation, the real estate industry isn’t pleased with most of the regulations, some of which will bite agents and brokers who buy and flip properties as a sideline, as well as developers looking to presell a sufficient number of units so they can secure construction loans and begin building.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Christopher Alexander, president of Re/Max Canada, says the vacant homes tax will play an important role in the market in the years to come: “I think that’s a good move,” he says. “We have a serious inventory challenge and a supply shortage that runs deep. We are going to need every piece of product we possibly can bring on to help offset the incredible demand we’re going to continue to have for years to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As for renovators, many in recent years have built thriving businesses around buying, fixing up and then re-selling homes – a practice where the government now says it will treat any resulting capital gains as business income for tax purposes, meaning that tax filers claiming the principal residence capital gains exemption will attract more scrutiny from CRA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawyer Debbie Pearl-Weinberg, executive director of CIBC’s wealth advisory services, describes the 365-day anti-flipping rule as a “bright line test” but adds that renovators who wait for a few days past the deadline to list could still find themselves in CRA’s crosshairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think taxpayers can expect that if they just make sure that they don’t sell within that 365-day period, that they [can] be rest assured that it is capital gain,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking ahead to the next economic cycle, Mr. Giralico predicts that while prices will recover, some of the frothier corners of the industry may be altered permanently. “As a gentleman that works on commission, I’d like to make as much money as I can,” he concedes. But, he adds, “I don’t see [preconstruction assignments] being as busy as a few years ago. I don’t think we’ll hit those volumes again simply because there are a lot of things in place now where, you know, not every guy can just come in to buy, whether they can afford it or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sidebar: Toronto’s Vacant Home Tax\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year, when the City of Toronto mailed out a notification of the new vacant homes tax, printed on double-side yellow paper, many residents noticed that the accompanying website – toronto.ca/VacantHomeTax – wasn’t yet operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "The site, which allows owners to fill out a formal declaration of occupancy, has since come on line, and indeed city officials report that as of Jan. 12, 55 per cent of all owners had submitted their declaration. A “robust public awareness campaign” is now in full swing, according to a spokesperson, and it includes a notification that will be sent out with interim property tax notices and individual follow-up reminders sent out after the Feb. 3 deadline.\n",
      "\n",
      "The move to implement a vacant home tax dates back to 2019, and was estimated in 2021 to cost about $11-million in start-up expenses, with an outlay of about $3.1-million annually to keep it running. City officials at the time predicted gross revenues of $55-million to $66-million, based on a ballpark estimate that about one percent of Toronto’s housing stock is vacant. Staff admitted, however, that the actual number of vacant dwellings was unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also unknown: the full range of circumstances that will fall between the cracks of the bylaw, which outlines exemptions, such as vacancy due to renovations or the hospitalization of the owner. In fact, Toronto lawyers have been fielding calls from anxious clients about situations not covered by the enumerated exemptions, such as tenants that don’t have written leases, or owners who’ve been living abroad for extended periods due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the recent drop in real estate prices, the cost of the tax will be significant: a one-time hit of $15,000 on a $1.5-million home.\n"

Planner Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program, observes that the federal government’s new anti-flipping rule doesn’t apply to one of the most intensely speculative sectors, which is preconstruction assignments by foreign investors. Still, Mr. Yan adds, the growing list of restrictions and taxes is beginning to look like a systemic response to a housing crisis which he describes is 30 years in the making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether or not these measures succeed in tamping down speculation, the real estate industry isn’t pleased with most of the regulations, some of which will bite agents and brokers who buy and flip properties as a sideline, as well as developers looking to presell a sufficient number of units so they can secure construction loans and begin building.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Christopher Alexander, president of Re/Max Canada, says the vacant homes tax will play an important role in the market in the years to come: “I think that’s a good move,” he says. “We have a serious inventory challenge and a supply shortage that runs deep. We are going to need every piece of product we possibly can bring on to help offset the incredible demand we’re going to continue to have for years to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As for renovators, many in recent years have built thriving businesses around buying, fixing up and then re-selling homes – a practice where the government now says it will treat any resulting capital gains as business income for tax purposes, meaning that tax filers claiming the principal residence capital gains exemption will attract more scrutiny from CRA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawyer Debbie Pearl-Weinberg, executive director of CIBC’s wealth advisory services, describes the 365-day anti-flipping rule as a “bright line test” but adds that renovators who wait for a few days past the deadline to list could still find themselves in CRA’s crosshairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think taxpayers can expect that if they just make sure that they don’t sell within that 365-day period, that they [can] be rest assured that it is capital gain,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking ahead to the next economic cycle, Mr. Giralico predicts that while prices will recover, some of the frothier corners of the industry may be altered permanently. “As a gentleman that works on commission, I’d like to make as much money as I can,” he concedes. But, he adds, “I don’t see [preconstruction assignments] being as busy as a few years ago. I don’t think we’ll hit those volumes again simply because there are a lot of things in place now where, you know, not every guy can just come in to buy, whether they can afford it or not.”\n",

      "Sidebar: Toronto’s Vacant Home Tax\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year, when the City of Toronto mailed out a notification of the new vacant homes tax, printed on double-side yellow paper, many residents noticed that the accompanying website – toronto.ca/VacantHomeTax – wasn’t yet operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "The site, which allows owners to fill out a formal declaration of occupancy, has since come on line, and indeed city officials report that as of Jan. 12, 55 per cent of all owners had submitted their declaration. A “robust public awareness campaign” is now in full swing, according to a spokesperson, and it includes a notification that will be sent out with interim property tax notices and individual follow-up reminders sent out after the Feb. 3 deadline.\n",
      "\n",
      "The move to implement a vacant home tax dates back to 2019, and was estimated in 2021 to cost about $11-million in start-up expenses, with an outlay of about $3.1-million annually to keep it running. City officials at the time predicted gross revenues of $55-million to $66-million, based on a ballpark estimate that about one percent of Toronto’s housing stock is vacant. Staff admitted, however, that the actual number of vacant dwellings was unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also unknown: the full range of circumstances that will fall between the cracks of the bylaw, which outlines exemptions, such as vacancy due to renovations or the hospitalization of the owner. In fact, Toronto lawyers have been fielding calls from anxious clients about situations not covered by the enumerated exemptions, such as tenants that don’t have written leases, or owners who’ve been living abroad for extended periods due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the recent drop in real estate prices, the cost of the tax will be significant: a one-time hit of $15,000 on a $1.5-million home.\n"

      "\n",
      "Lawyer Debbie Pearl-Weinberg, executive director of CIBC’s wealth advisory services, describes the 365-day anti-flipping rule as a “bright line test” but adds that renovators who wait for a few days past the deadline to list could still find themselves in CRA’s crosshairs.\n",

But, he adds, “I don’t see [preconstruction assignments] being as busy as a few years ago.

      "Earlier this year, when the City of Toronto mailed out a notification of the new vacant homes tax, printed on double-side yellow paper, many residents noticed that the accompanying website – toronto.ca/VacantHomeTax – wasn’t yet operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "The site, which allows owners to fill out a formal declaration of occupancy, has since come on line, and indeed city officials report that as of Jan. 12, 55 per cent of all owners had submitted their declaration. A “robust public awareness campaign” is now in full swing, according to a spokesperson, and it includes a notification that will be sent out with interim property tax notices and individual follow-up reminders sent out after the Feb. 3 deadline.\n",
      "\n",
      "The move to implement a vacant home tax dates back to 2019, and was estimated in 2021 to cost about $11-million in start-up expenses, with an outlay of about $3.1-million annually to keep it running. City officials at the time predicted gross revenues of $55-million to $66-million, based on a ballpark estimate that about one percent of Toronto’s housing stock is vacant. Staff admitted, however, that the actual number of vacant dwellings was unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also unknown: the full range of circumstances that will fall between the cracks of the bylaw, which outlines exemptions, such as vacancy due to renovations or the hospitalization of the owner. In fact, Toronto lawyers have been fielding calls from anxious clients about situations not covered by the enumerated exemptions, such as tenants that don’t have written leases, or owners who’ve been living abroad for extended periods due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the recent drop in real estate prices, the cost of the tax will be significant: a one-time hit of $15,000 on a $1.5-million home.\n"

      "\n",
      "In a major retreat on Friday, the federal government withdrew controversial amendments to its gun-control bill. The now-removed changes would have cemented bans on thousands of assault-style firearms, but had been widely criticized for also targeting guns used by hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said his government would try to refine and reintroduce the prohibitions on assault-style guns – a move for which the Bloc Québécois signalled its support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberal House Leader Mark Holland wouldn’t say whether the aim was for that to be done through a new round of amendments to the bill, known as C-21, or through an entirely new law.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We didn’t get it right,” Mr. Holland told reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amendments, which expanded the scope of Bill C-21 beyond its original focus on handguns, were tabled by the Liberals late in the parliamentary process, without explanation. The changes angered such a wide swath of Canadians, including First Nations leaders and premiers, that the minority government lost the support it needed from the NDP and Bloc Québécois to pass the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Friday withdrawal of the amendments was formalized at the Commons public safety committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes “really derailed” progress on the bill, NDP MP Alistair MacGregor told fellow committee members. “I’ve never seen such a groundswell of opposition come really from everywhere, all at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a news conference, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre took credit for the government’s reversal, saying his party had forced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “into a temporary but humiliating climbdown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trudeau and his ministers had staunchly defended the amendments, which would have legislated a prohibition on thousands of assault-style firearms and established a legal definition of guns to be banned automatically in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November and December, the Prime Minister blamed the widespread opposition, in part, on disinformation from the Conservatives, who he said were attempting to “scare everyone as much as possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trudeau first denied that the prohibitions would affect guns used for hunting, and then late in December acknowledged to CTV News that the government amendments would “take away” some hunting guns that are “too dangerous in other contexts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, Mr. Holland reversed the government’s message yet again. “We are committed to not affecting hunting,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the government withdrew the amendments because it failed to properly draw the line between guns legally used for hunting and those that are used in mass killings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We acknowledge and regret that the consultations that we undertook were not sufficient, and that there were gaps and problems in the amendments. That’s why we’ve retracted them,” Mr. Holland said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amendments had strong support from gun-control groups, in part because they would have made it more difficult for a future government to reverse existing bans on assault-style weapons, which are currently enacted through regulations, rather than legislation. Those bans cover guns used in mass shootings such as the 1989 mass murder of 14 women at École Polytechnique in Montreal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement Friday, Nathalie Provost, a spokesperson for the gun-control advocacy organization PolySeSouvient, established in the aftermath of that mass murder, said the group was shocked and dismayed by the government’s decision, but that it is still hopeful the amendments can be reintroduced after more consultation and revision.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The government needs only one opposition party to deliver on their promise to ban assault weapons and it would be unthinkable for the Bloc not to collaborate in this regard,” Ms. Provost said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill C-21 was introduced in May, 2022, just days after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex. The legislation was designed to freeze the sale of handguns, crack down on gun smuggling and automatically revoke firearms licences from domestic abusers. Advocates who had criticized Mr. Trudeau for not delivering on promises to enact stronger gun control welcomed the bill as the first substantive move in a generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Nov. 22, after witness testimony on Bill C-21 before the public safety committee had wrapped, the government tacked on the amendments, which expanded the bill to cover assault-style firearms. The changes were introduced by Liberal MP Paul Chiang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amendments were introduced in two sections. The first was a list of thousands of banned firearms. It also listed exceptions to the bans.\n",
      "\n",
      "That list primarily moved bans on firearms already done through regulation into legislation, but also added 482 more guns to the prohibition. The second section included language that would have automatically banned future weapons before they came on the market, if they were assault-style firearms as defined by the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government did not explain the amendments to the public when they were first introduced. Mr. Mendicino’s office later said the government had consulted three gun-control groups on the changes, but no hunting or gun-rights groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rod Giltaca, chief executive and executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, said in an interview that his organization is “very pleased at this retreat by the Liberals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling the amendments’ withdrawal a “small but meaningful victory,” Mr. Giltaca said the organization remains concerned about how the government will approach gun control in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement Friday, Mr. Mendicino said the government will work with opposition parties to “craft a clear solution that will keep assault-style weapons off our streets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloc MP Kristina Michaud said in a statement that withdrawing the amendments was the right call. But she urged the government to try again and “do more” to prohibit assault-style weapons while respecting the rights of hunters. She said the focus should be on establishing a definition of what constitutes an assault-style weapon, rather than banning individual gun models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. MacGregor told reporters Friday that he would reserve judgment on any new attempt from the government to revive its legislated assault-style weapons ban. He said he believes that the initial amendments fell outside the scope of Bill C-21.\n"

      "\n",
      "In the last few years, Frank Giralico, a sales representative for Capital North Realty, was doing a brisk trade in the Greater Toronto Area’s “preconstruction assignment market,” in which investors ante up a down-payment on an as-yet unbuilt condo and then flip the rights to purchase it for a profit before the unit is constructed, never actually intending to own it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That market hums along when prices are going up, and seizes up when they’re coming down, or when interest rates have spiked. “I focused a lot of my business on that because the market was geared that way,” he admits. Things are different now: “I’ve seen investors who are now faced with the reality that they’re either going to have to come up with extra funds because the mortgage rate has increased so much that they may not be able to close.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The frothy trade in preconstruction assignments drove the near record growth of the condo sector in 2021, and its collapse has contributed to its abrupt down-shifting in recent months, with Urbanation reporting a 79-per-cent decline in new sales in Q3 2021. As one of the many Youtube real estate investing channels recently noted in an hour-long post-mortem featuring @Precondo founder Jordan Scrinko, Pre-Construction Assignment Sales Are DEAD In Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons aren’t especially difficult to fathom. Intent on breaking the back of the inflation that’s stream-rollered the economy, the Bank of Canada’s aggressive rate hikes have made it much more difficult for buyers to prequalify for loans and, in some cases, come up with adequate funds to close a deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are other drivers at work, too – a series of federal and municipal policies, several of which came into force on Jan. 1, 2023, that are designed to throw even more cold water on the housing market and its eye-popping prices. These include:\n",
      "\n",
      "New anti-flipping rules, which taxes 100 per cent of the capital gains on a property sold within 365 days of purchase;\n",
      "\n",
      "The City of Toronto’s vacant home tax, which takes effect Feb. 3 and imposes a tax of 1 per cent of market value on unoccupied homes that don’t qualify for exemptions (see sidebar);\n",
      "\n",
      "A two-year moratorium on the purchase of residential real estate by foreign buyers;\n",
      "\n",
      "New Canada Revenue Agency rules requiring investors and speculators to pay HST on profits from preconstruction assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "These regulations layer onto several earlier measures – e.g., B.C.’s speculation and vacant homes tax and Ontario’s foreign home buyers tax – that also sought to take some of the steam out of the market at a time when governments across the country are looking for ways to stoke the construction of new homes and affordable apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other jurisdictions have tried similar measures to take the energy out of their own properties markets: New York State passed an anti-flipping law a decade ago. California last year passed a similar law, imposing a 25-per-cent tax on homes resold within three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the question of whether such policies or the Bank of Canada’s interest rate hikes succeeded in cooling the market is largely academic, there’s not much compelling evidence that anti-speculation laws have a significant impact on prices or availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murtaza Haider, who studies real estate management at Toronto Metropolitan University, says the data on B.C.’s vacant home tax shows only a modest effect, and doesn’t expect that Toronto’s new vacant homes policy will free up a lot of empty dwellings. “It doesn’t mean tens of thousands of new units will be available.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Olaf Weber, a University of Waterloo scholar who has studied such measures, adds that these moves “[show] that the government tries to do something. Many [people] will agree that international investors drive prices up. That’s a pretty simple narrative.” But, he adds, “I don’t think it will really change the market and create more affordable housing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Others, however, argue that the recent spate of policies haven’t gone far enough. Planner Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program, observes that the federal government’s new anti-flipping rule doesn’t apply to one of the most intensely speculative sectors, which is preconstruction assignments by foreign investors. Still, Mr. Yan adds, the growing list of restrictions and taxes is beginning to look like a systemic response to a housing crisis which he describes is 30 years in the making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether or not these measures succeed in tamping down speculation, the real estate industry isn’t pleased with most of the regulations, some of which will bite agents and brokers who buy and flip properties as a sideline, as well as developers looking to presell a sufficient number of units so they can secure construction loans and begin building.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Christopher Alexander, president of Re/Max Canada, says the vacant homes tax will play an important role in the market in the years to come: “I think that’s a good move,” he says. “We have a serious inventory challenge and a supply shortage that runs deep. We are going to need every piece of product we possibly can bring on to help offset the incredible demand we’re going to continue to have for years to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As for renovators, many in recent years have built thriving businesses around buying, fixing up and then re-selling homes – a practice where the government now says it will treat any resulting capital gains as business income for tax purposes, meaning that tax filers claiming the principal residence capital gains exemption will attract more scrutiny from CRA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawyer Debbie Pearl-Weinberg, executive director of CIBC’s wealth advisory services, describes the 365-day anti-flipping rule as a “bright line test” but adds that renovators who wait for a few days past the deadline to list could still find themselves in CRA’s crosshairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think taxpayers can expect that if they just make sure that they don’t sell within that 365-day period, that they [can] be rest assured that it is capital gain,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking ahead to the next economic cycle, Mr. Giralico predicts that while prices will recover, some of the frothier corners of the industry may be altered permanently. “As a gentleman that works on commission, I’d like to make as much money as I can,” he concedes. But, he adds, “I don’t see [preconstruction assignments] being as busy as a few years ago. I don’t think we’ll hit those volumes again simply because there are a lot of things in place now where, you know, not every guy can just come in to buy, whether they can afford it or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sidebar: Toronto’s Vacant Home Tax\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year, when the City of Toronto mailed out a notification of the new vacant homes tax, printed on double-side yellow paper, many residents noticed that the accompanying website – toronto.ca/VacantHomeTax – wasn’t yet operational.\n",
      "\n",
      "The site, which allows owners to fill out a formal declaration of occupancy, has since come on line, and indeed city officials report that as of Jan. 12, 55 per cent of all owners had submitted their declaration. A “robust public awareness campaign” is now in full swing, according to a spokesperson, and it includes a notification that will be sent out with interim property tax notices and individual follow-up reminders sent out after the Feb. 3 deadline.\n",

      "['Harvey Schachter'] 2023-02-06 05:00:00-05:00 My first experience with incentive bonuses came after our company was acquired on the lip of a recession. When that downturn gained traction, bonuses disappeared. That didn’t matter for my long-standing colleagues as we had never benefited from them, but our new colleagues were furious that they were working harder than ever and not getting remunerated accordingly. It was a sign to me that something was rotten in Incentiveland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incentives are tricky. But too often corporate executives, often benefiting from bonuses themselves, succumb to magical thinking on incentives, assuming the reaction will be automatic – offer an incentive, and people will grasp for it, like mice in a Pavlovian lab experiment, and the company will live happily ever after. But humans are more complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the best insights have been piling up in behavioural economics studies. Of course, behavioural experiments are often with university students doing simplistic tasks and need to be received with caution but some research tries to replicate the work situation or is carried out within companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "A study with bankers found evidence they put more money into risky investments when bonuses were at stake in a competitive situation, only the top producing ones being rewarded. “Once you’re in the rear, only taking higher risks offers you the opportunity to get to the front of the line and receive a bonus payment. Similarly, if you suffered losses, you can escape them more quickly if you take higher risks,” Matthias Sutter, director of the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods, writes in his fascinating book, Behavioral Economics for Leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "He warns not to use bonuses to offer incentives unwittingly to sabotage colleagues, which is a problem surfacing with relative performance bonuses. For many organizations, promotions, raises in salaries and bonus payments are made dependent on relative performance compared to others in the company. This creates competition for the best and most lucrative positions in the company. That fits the competitive ethos many leaders subscribe to but can unleash dangerous passions, as Mr. Sutter shows by recalling how the competition for the one position to skate on behalf of the United States in the 1994 Olympic Games led Tonya Harding to hire a hitman to injure her main competitor, Nancy Kerrigan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a lab experiment by Cologne University economics professor Bernd Irlenbusch, participants divided into teams of three employees and a boss to compete for a bonus they could win if they were the most productive employee. Instead of investing in their own productivity they could reduce the performance of the other two by destroying their work. The level of sabotage increased the higher the bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, communication between the three employees in the team lowered the level of sabotage. “When people know one another better, they are less likely to act in destructive ways,” Mr. Sutter says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various studies have shown people are more willing to lie to gain an advantage over another person. But again, there can be a relational retardant. If the damage becomes substantial to the other person, they are more likely to refrain from lying. In that vein, studies by Francesca Gino and Max Bazerman of Harvard Business School suggest that leaders should not tolerate minor ethical infractions because there can be a slippery slope of small-scale cheating leading to major corruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paying people more doesn’t mean they will make better decisions. (Are you listening, boards of directors?) A laboratory experiment by famed behavioural economist Dan Ariely asked participants in India to figure out six different tasks that had to do with logic, creative thinking and cognitive and physical abilities. In one situation, they could gain 400 rupees per task, enough for a month’s typical purchases for goods and services in one hour’s work. You might expect that to produce the best work, but in fact it led to the most errors. And errors in decision-making can, of course, be costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bakery with outlets across Germany that wanted to offer incentives to boost productivity experimented with a team bonus if certain sales targets were achieved because the performance of each person was hard to quantify. The executives were initially wary because they felt a team bonus would lead to freeloading behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bonus was tried in 97 bakeries while a control group of 96 outlets in the same chain had no such payments. Sales increased by 3 per cent in the bonus bakeries – more in revenue than the cost of the bonuses – and after three months the idea was extended to all the bakeries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, the bonuses didn’t increase job satisfaction. Undercover shoppers didn’t find any difference in the frequency with which the bakery employees asked if they wanted anything else. It seems that the employees became more co-operative with each other to accelerate the sales process – one person handling the doughnuts and rolls, another the cash register – and in lulls they cleaned up the coffee machine and oven and prepared more sandwiches.\n",
      "\n",
      "So next time you’re thinking about incentives, perhaps begin with how to encourage teamwork rather than individual competition.\n",

      "\n",
      "Matt Malone is an assistant professor in the faculty of law at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Canadian transportation regulator whose mandate includes consumer protection of air passengers has 36,000 outstanding complaints before it. For complaints it manages to process, the agency has barely issued fines on airlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the two-year-plus stretch between March 1, 2020, and Sept. 12, 2022, the Canadian Transportation Agency levied just 27 fines on airlines (including just one at the maximum amount) under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations, the federal government’s much-vaunted air passenger Bill of Rights. Meanwhile, during roughly this same period, the government issued more than 1,000 fines for non-compliance with ArriveCan, the glitchy border app mandated during the COVID-19 pandemic for travellers entering the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "One might wonder what kind of people sit on the CTA tribunal to accomplish such nonaction. It turns out, not the kind of people who should be regulating airlines. They should be fired and replaced with people who will defend air passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vice-chair of the agency from 2013-18, Sam Barone, was a registered lobbyist for airlines. The last chair, Scott Streiner, left the agency in 2021 to become an adviser on transportation at Deloitte, a consultancy firm whose clients include airlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Streiner repeatedly allowed the agency to issue decision letters green-lighting anti-competitive consolidation in the Canadian airline industry. Under his leadership, the CTA also published the notorious Statement on Vouchers in March, 2020, that let airlines deny refunds to passengers by instead issuing vouchers subject to tortuous conditions. Air Passenger Rights, a grassroots organization, sued the agency over that conduct. One of the lawyers defending the lawsuit on behalf of the agency was later appointed as a tribunal member.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since her appointment as chair in 2021, France Pégeot has met with industry lobbyists at a brisk clip and is on track to meet Mr. Streiner’s record over his six-year tenure. So, it is hardly surprising the Air Passenger Protection Regulations have failed to take off under her leadership. Last year, the agency’s tribunal averaged a dismal annual rate of 2.4 decisions per tribunal member that actually invoked the regulations. The median decision was just 975 words long.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such a track record, it should come as no surprise the CTA goes to great lengths to conceal information from Canadians. It only discloses the number of air passenger complaints by “number of complaints per 100 flights,” making it difficult to grasp the extent of the problem. As The Globe and Mail reported last week, it does not even track the outcomes of 97 per cent of claims. Relevant requests for information through the access-to-information system are often almost entirely redacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agency knows what Canadians think about this state of affairs. In the past, it conducted client satisfaction surveys. But it stopped publishing those surveys after 2016. So last fall, I requested more recent ones (if they exist.) Right after I put in my access-to-information request, the agency disabled the relevant section of their site.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CTA has come to represent the antithesis of consumer protection for air passengers at a time the industry desperately needs a robust regulator. In the past year, Canada has been ranked dead last in the world for flight delays – a national embarrassment. More recently, airlines have stranded people in foreign countries; over the holidays, Air Canada trapped passengers inside an airplane on a tarmac for 11 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to that last episode, a vice-president of Air Canada in January told a House of Commons committee with a straight face: “When it is unsafe and we could jeopardize making things worse, we will always take the side of safety.” Such excuses of “safety” have played a critical role in enfeebling the Air Passenger Protection Regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government has responded with promises of revising the passenger Bill of Rights. “Stay tuned – you’ll see action,” Transport Minister Omar Alghabra recently stated, “you’ll see new tools introduced. Mark my words.” But new tools are not what we need. New regulators would do much better.\n",

      "\n",
      "Officials say the investigation is now ongoing after 12 people were injured in an apparent gas explosion that rocked an east Ottawa suburb on Monday morning, including two children and two people who were pulled out of the rubble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two kids were among six taken to hospital immediately after the explosion at an Orleans housing development, Ottawa Paramedic Services said. Two men suffered serious injuries, but all in hospital were in stable condition, paramedics said. Other injured people were released at the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "All people in the neighbourhood have since been accounted for, said Nicholas DeFazio, a public information officer with Ottawa Fire Services – with a city councillor for the area saying it’s a “miracle” more weren’t hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeFazio said Monday afternoon that the cause of the explosion was still under investigation despite firefighters initially saying that a gas leak was the culprit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blast occurred at about 6:18 a.m. local time and destroyed four homes that were under construction in a Minto Group development, said Ottawa deputy fire chief David Matschke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other houses in the development are already built and occupied, but police would not provide information about whether any residents needed to vacate their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police and firefighters also would not say whether the injured people included any residents of nearby homes, or whether any of the injured people were construction workers – though DeFazio confirmed that construction workers were on the scene at the time of the explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two people were caught under debris. The first was freed after firefighters used a chainsaw to cut through wreckage, with the fire service saying on Twitter that the individual was “stable and talking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "About three hours after the explosion, firefighters said they rescued a second person who was trapped inside a collapsed home and “surrounded by a large amount of debris.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ottawa Fire Services said in a tweet late in the afternoon on Monday that it had been “a successful double rescue in extreme circumstances.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Amy Bond, an inspector with the Ottawa Police Service, said the force was working with Ontario’s Ministry of Labour and the Ontario Office of the Fire Marshal, which is now leading the investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s very early stages,” Bond said Monday. “The scene is quite large.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bond said that police will remain on the scene into the evening and possibly into Tuesday, depending on how the investigation unfolds. Representatives from Enbridge Gas were also on the scene but did not speak to reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orleans South Coun. Catherine Kitts called the explosion a “distressing event” for residents and said the Canadian Red Cross and Salvation Army were also providing help.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Given the intensity of the blast, it’s a bit of a miracle there weren’t more serious injuries,” Kitts said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitts said the Salvation Army and Canadian Red Cross were set up at the Minto Sales Centre on Monday, down the street from the site of the explosion, to help people who have been displaced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Debris from the explosion could be found blocks away from the original site. Across the street from the development were broken windows and a dusting of pink insulation that began to blend into melting snowbanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mana Karki, who lives nearby, said she decided to take the day off work because she was “still in shock.” Her garage door was destroyed in the blast, and her stairs were cracked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a big bang. Loud. I was freaking out,” Karki said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another resident, Mayank Sharma, said the explosion jolted him awake. He said he rushed to his children, who were crying about “the big bang.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We couldn’t figure out what the issue was. It was like a bomb explosion, a plane crashed or someone banged into someone’s house,” Sharma said. “We just couldn’t figure out what it was until we started hearing things. And we saw a police car on our street, and I think we heard there was a gas leakage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rows of police cars, fire trucks and ambulances had stretched across the road in the early morning. By noon, a majority of the emergency personnel had left the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "His friend Divya Suri, who also lives nearby, said the explosion left cracks in her home’s ceiling and walls and damaged her garage door. The fire service said the destroyed houses were under construction in the areas of 10th Line Road and Shallow Pond Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The homes were under development by Minto Group. The developer says it has a team on the ground to address the needs of the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other model homes are being used as temporary shelter spaces for residents who have been evacuated, said Brent Strachan, the group’s president for Ontario.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are working with authorities to identify the cause of the explosion and fully co-operating in the investigation,” Strachan said in a statement Monday. “We will share more information as it becomes available. As always, safety is our top priority, and our thoughts are with everyone affected.”\n",

      "['Will Dunham'] 2023-02-15 13:39:46-05:00 A perfectly spherical explosion, called a kilonova, that followed the merger of two very dense objects called neutron stars – remnants of massive stars after supernova explosions – that was observed 140-150 million light-years away from Earth.ALBERT SNEPPEN/Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Astronomers have observed what might be the “perfect explosion,” a colossal and utterly spherical blast triggered by the merger of two very dense stellar remnants called neutron stars shortly before the combined entity collapsed to form a black hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers on Wednesday described for the first time the contours of the type of explosion, called a kilonova, that occurs when neutron stars merge. The rapidly expanding fireball of luminous matter they detailed defied their expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two neutron stars, with a combined mass about 2.7 times that of our sun, had orbited each other for billions of years before colliding at high speeds and exploding. This unfolded in a galaxy called NGC 4993, about 140-150 million light years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Hydra. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n",
      "\n",
      "The existence of kilonova explosions was proposed in 1974 and confirmed in 2013, but what they looked like was unknown until this one was detected in 2017 and studied intensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a perfect explosion in several ways. It is beautiful, both aesthetically, in the simplicity of the shape, and in its physical significance,” said astrophysicist Albert Sneppen of the Cosmic Dawn Center in Copenhagen, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aesthetically, the colours the kilonova emits quite literally look like a sun – except, of course, being a few hundred million times larger in surface area. Physically, this spherical explosion contains the extraordinary physics at the heart of this merger,” Sneppen added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers had expected the explosion to perhaps look like a flattened disk – a colossal luminous cosmic pancake, possibly with a jet of material streaming out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be honest, we are really going back to the drawing board with this,” Cosmic Dawn Center astrophysicist and study co-author Darach Watson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Given the extreme nature of the physical conditions – far more extreme than a nuclear explosion, for example, with densities greater than an atomic nucleus, temperatures of billions of degrees and magnetic fields strong enough to distort the shapes of atoms – there may well be fundamental physics here that we don’t understand yet,” Watson added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kilonova was studied using the European Southern Observatory’s Chile-based Very Large Telescope.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two neutron stars began their lives as massive normal stars in a two-star system called a binary. Each exploded and collapsed after running out of fuel, leaving behind a small and dense core about 12 miles (20 km) in diameter but packing more mass than the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very gradually, they drew nearer to each other, orbiting at a speedy clip. Each were stretched out and pulled apart in the final seconds before the merger because of the power of the other’s gravitational field. Their inner parts collided at about 25% of the speed of light, creating the most intense magnetic fields in the universe. The explosion unleashed the luminosity of about a billion suns for a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two briefly formed a single massive neutron star that then collapsed to form a black hole, an even denser object with gravity so fierce that not even light can escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outer parts of the neutron stars, meanwhile, were stretched into long streamers, with some material flung into space. During the process, the densities and temperatures were so intense that heavy elements were forged, including gold, platinum, arsenic, uranium and iodine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers offered some hypotheses to explain the spherical shape of the explosion, including energy released from the short-lived single neutron star’s enormous magnetic field or the role of enigmatic particles called neutrinos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is fundamentally astonishing, and an exciting challenge for any theoreticians and numerical simulations,” Sneppen said. “The game is on.”\n"

      "\n",
      "A remote northwestern Ontario First Nation lacked the facilities to extinguish a house fire that left one dead and two others missing, two local leaders said as they implored the federal government for help bolstering fire services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CEO of the Independent First Nations Alliance, a group that represents five communities in the region, said the blaze that erupted in Pikangikum First Nation on Wednesday evening has left its residents “crushed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The community is very frustrated, very angry, very sad,” Mathew Hope said in a telephone interview on Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That night of extreme cold, people were doing their best to fight the fire and deal with it, but the fire crew couldn’t prevent it due to frozen water hoses, nozzles. It was very dire circumstances.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Pikangikum Chief Shirley Lynne Keeper issued a statement on Friday saying fire crews were unable to douse the flames because the community’s two fire trucks were having mechanical issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our fire trucks were frozen because we don’t have an adequate building to keep them warm,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeper said Pikangikum is “devastated” after losing more residents to yet another house fire, recalling the 2016 blaze that killed a family of nine on the First Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have never felt so hopeless,” Keeper said in the statement. “Our ability to fight structural fires has not improved since 2016. … We are still investigating this tragic fire and we ask everyone to pray for the family and our community.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dean and Annette Strang, their son Gilbert, their daughter Faith, Faith’s three children and two common-law partners died in the 2016 fire. All three children were under the age of five.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many community members lost family. This has affected us greatly. We never wanted to see this happen again,” Keeper said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope said he couldn’t identify the three people involved in Wednesday’s blaze, but said they are a family who lived in the “close knit” neighbourhood affectionately known as “Smurfs’ Village” because the homes in that area have blue walls. The search for the two people still unaccounted for after the fire continued over the weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope said the federal government has been in touch with the community and has been involved in ongoing meetings with local leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indigenous Services Canada did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope and Keeper lamented the lack of government progress in addressing fire-related safety concerns since 2016 and called for immediate action to support the community of about 4,000 people, located about 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, Ont.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The government’s response to date has been unacceptable. No more words, we need action,” Keeper said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope agreed, saying there is a major discrepancy between fire services available in Indigenous communities and those on offer elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That capacity for emergency services and fire departments do not exist to the same level that other communities, municipalities enjoy,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2021 Statistics Canada report commissioned by the National Indigenous Fire Safety Council found First Nations people living on reserves are about 10 times more likely to die in a fire than non-Indigenous Canadians.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week’s fire in Pikangikum is the latest fatal blaze to strike First Nations in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 10-year-old girl died last month after a house fire on the Weenusk First Nation, a northern community in Peawanuck, Ont.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nishnawbe Aski Nation, a group representing 49 First Nations in northern Ontario, said at the time the community’s newly purchased fire truck was still stuck in Winnipeg awaiting shipment when the fire broke out.\n",
      "\n",
      "NAN’s Deputy Chief Anna Betty Achneepineskum added several member communities have had to grapple with deadly house fires over the past decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "That includes Sandy Lake First Nation, where three children died in a fire last January. Mishkeegogamang First Nation, meanwhile, lost four residents in 2014, including two young children.\n"

      "['Adrian Sainz'] 2023-03-03 18:17:24-05:00 A former Memphis Fire Department emergency medical technician told a Tennessee board Friday that officers “impeded patient care” by refusing to remove Tyre Nichols’ handcuffs, which would have allowed EMTs to check his vital signs after he was brutally beaten by police.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robert Long, whose license was suspended for failing to give aid to Nichols and who has also been fired, appeared by livestream before the state Emergency Medical Services Board to share his version of events. He provided details about how he and another EMT, JaMichael Sandridge, responded after five Memphis police officers had punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a baton during an arrest following Nichols fleeing a traffic stop Jan. 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long and Sandridge were fired by the department Jan. 30. Their licenses were suspended by the board Feb. 3, after members watched a 19-minute video taken at the beating location. Officials said the EMTs failed to render aid to Nichols, who died three days after the beating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The board determined that Long and Sandridge did not perform basic emergency medical examinations while Nichols was handcuffed on the ground and slumped against a squad car, documents obtained by The Associated Press showed. Nichols showed “clear signs of distress, such as the inability to remain in a seated posture and laying prone on the ground multiple times,” the documents showed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Long and Sandridge failed to initiate a primary examination, which could have helped identify the presence of any life-threatening injuries, the documents showed. Nichols’ vital signs were not checked, he did not receive high-flow oxygen or an intravenous line, and he was not placed on a heart monitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two EMTs were joined at the arrest location by a third fire department employee, Lt. Michelle Whitaker, who officials said remained in the fire engine with the driver during the response to Nichols’ beating. She has since been fired, but it was not immediately clear if the state board would take action towards suspending her license.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five officers who were seen on video beating Nichols have been fired and charged with second-degree murder. They have pleaded not guilty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Long testified Friday, his lawyer, Darrell O’Neal, noted that the 19-minute video taken by an elevated pole camera and seen by the board did not have sound, and it did not capture what was said during the violent arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long gave a detailed account of what officers, Nichols and he himself said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long said he approached Nichols and saw that he had “a bump on his head, a busted lip and a dried bloody nose on both nostrils,” but that he answered “Tyre Nichols” when asked his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said Nichols then asked him for help standing up and to remove the handcuffs. Nichols repeated this request several times, Long said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long said he repeatedly tried to place a monitor on Nichols to check his vital signs, including blood pressure, but Nichols would roll away. Long said he interpreted this movement as Nichols rejecting care and refusing co-operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He wouldn’t stay still for assessment,” Long said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long said he did not force the blood pressure cuff onto Nichols or hold him down in fear of being accused of assault.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said he asked Nichols if had been using drugs or alcohol, and Nichols said he had only been drinking. Long said he interpreted some of Nichols’ movements, including being slumped against the car or on the ground, as the result of drinking alcohol.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, officers leaned over Nichols and were “in his face, saying loudly that the patient is not going anywhere and that they are not going to uncuff him, impeding patient care,” according to Long.\n",
      "\n",
      "They continued to impede his care, Long said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, Nichols stopped moving and became unresponsive, Long said. An ambulance arrived, and Nichols was taken to a hospital. Officials have said 27 minutes elapsed from the time the EMTs arrived on the scene to the moment the ambulance left for the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Gibbs, an Tennessee Department of Health lawyer, asked Long if a field sobriety test or a blood alcohol exam had been administered. Long said he was not aware if those were done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long also acknowledged that Nichols never verbally refused care from the EMTs, and he spent several minutes without directly engaging with Nichols.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long’s lawyer called a former Memphis paramedic and EMT, John Holloway, as an expert to testify. Holloway praised the actions that Long took and said that if he had touched Nichols, Long may have been in danger of accusations of assaulting him. Holloway said he did not believe Long would be a danger to the public if allowed to resume working as an EMT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holloway also noted that Long was the lowest ranking EMT on the scene, and the other two fire department employees who had more years of experience failed to step in to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holloway also said that Nichols could have been moving away from Long for a number of reasons. One board member suggested that Nichols could have been moving away from Long because Nichols was scared of being beaten again.\n",
      "\n",
      "After fours hours of testimony and questioning, the board voted to keep Long’s suspension in place.\n"

Alberta's UCP government, which has objected to the policy, is proposing legislation to establish a provincial role in how the federal policy is carried out in Alberta.JONATHAN HAYWARD/The Canadian Press\n",
      "\n",
      "Under new firearms legislation proposed in Alberta, Justice Minister Tyler Shandro would be granted powers to license “seizure agents” and oversee gun-related funding agreements between Ottawa and municipalities – including their police forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Alberta Firearms Act, introduced in the legislature on Tuesday, is the latest push by the United Conservative government against Ottawa’s ban and buyback program aimed at restricting “assault-style” weapons. Last September, Mr. Shandro directed the RCMP not to enforce the federal government’s program. Alberta has joined lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of banning certain guns.\n",
      "\n",
      "If passed, the legislation would also provide clarity on the role of the province’s chief firearms officer in enacting federal policy and outline compensation expectations for owners of affected weapons. To aid in these regulatory efforts, staffing in the office of the firearms officer would grow from 30 to 70 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Shandro said at a news conference that the goal is to provide clarity on the province’s role in overseeing firearms regulations because there is confusion and uncertainty with Ottawa’s overarching strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re all confused,” the Justice Minister said. “The act gives us the flexibility to quickly develop these responses and regulations to respond to the federal government’s actions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 1,500 different models of assault-style firearms have been banned in Canada since May, 2020. Canadians who possess these firearms have until the end of October to turn them in under an amnesty program.\n",
      "\n",
      "A federal gun-control bill remains under review after the Liberals withdrew an amendment outlining the definition of guns considered unsafe for civilian use amid criticism from Conservatives and firearms advocates, who said it would lead to the prohibition of commonly-used hunting rifles and shotguns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audrey Champoux, press secretary to federal Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino, said in a statement that Alberta is acting “recklessly” in its position on gun-related policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the primary responsibility of any government to keep their citizens safe, and the Government of Alberta’s consistent obstruction of common-sense gun policies is reckless,” Ms. Champoux said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Moreover, Canada’s courts have repeatedly confirmed that regulating firearms falls squarely within federal jurisdiction. Albertans expect their federal and provincial governments to work together to protect their communities, not try to pull stunts. Law enforcement will enforce the law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta’s bill states that the Justice Minister would be able to issue a license to individuals or businesses to act as “seizing agents” and has authority to renew, amend, suspend or cancel the license in accordance with the regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, Mr. Shandro said the province doesn’t think “there should be anyone involved in being engaged as a seizure agent for the confiscation program,” effectively making that part of the legislation cosmetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said there is great concern that municipalities are engaging with the federal government “to take their money” and hire city employees as “confiscation agents.” He said Alberta did not consult with city leaders – or Indigenous communities – before introducing Tuesday’s bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The legislation would make it law that a municipal entity, police service or police commission meets the province’s regulatory requirements before accepting funding from Ottawa to “support the enforcement of a specified enactment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Shandro pushed back at the idea that this is provincial overreach and said public safety, which is under their jurisdiction, comes into play with the movement of weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lisa Young, a political scientist with the University of Calgary, said that as the Alberta general election fast approaches, the UCP government’s introduction of their version of this bill accomplishes two objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first is to push back against the federal government in a policy area where the federal government’s approach is not terribly popular in Alberta,” Dr. Young said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The second thing that it accomplishes is that it sends signals to the party base that the government is listening and onside with them on an issue that I think is probably quite salient for that group.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Saskatchewan proposed a similar piece of legislation in December. It is billed as a way to protect firearms owners by establishing licensing requirements for individuals and businesses involved in seizing weapons, while requiring forensic and ballistic testing and fair compensation for confiscated firearms. It would also lead to the creation of a provincial firearms regulatory system to “promote the safe and responsible use of firearms.”\n",

      "\n",
      "On her first trip to Bolivia in January, Jane Park hiked about 20 kilometres with national park rangers to a steep, remote area with endangered palm trees and the Andean, or spectacled, bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the area in ANMI-El Palmar, one of the country’s protected areas, had been burned in a wildfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lot of areas where they are fighting fires are extremely remote,” Ms. Park said in a recent interview from Banff, Alta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Park, who’s on an unpaid leave from her regular job as a fire and vegetation specialist in Banff National Park, is one of two Alberta experts spending some of their off-season helping the Bolivian government prepare for an increase in fires due to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s part of Global Affairs Canada’s technical assistance partnership, which allows Canadians from different backgrounds to share their expertise in other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Park came across the opportunity online and got the contract with Alinea International, a development consultancy that administers the project. She started with the trip to Bolivia in January to tour five of the country’s protected areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trek to El Palmar, an integrated management natural area, was the same route park rangers took when the fire started.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s incredible,” Ms. Park said. “They walk enormous distances. They are local people, they are used to high elevation and they are extremely fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if you imagine that even the fittest rangers take several hours to walk into a fire, the amount of fire growth that would occur during that time and then the challenges that come with fighting it without aircraft or without decent sources of water, it’s all the more challenging.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Park added that the rangers carry portable water bladder packs and use machetes to fight the fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In Canada, we have easy access to aircraft and water,” she said. “So, there are definitely some interesting and very challenging conditions that folks have to work with down there. … We have to make sure we’re tailoring what we’re training to their reality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Park, who returned to Bolivia this week, said she’s helping the environmental departments improve their management practices and build capacity to respond to those fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s everything from prevention, suppression, wildfire management, communication, monitoring.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bolivia’s protected areas have high biodiversity, but wildfires – due to drought and longer fire seasons caused by climate change – have threatened them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global Forest Watch says the country lost 1.6 million hectares of tree cover in fires from 2001 to 2021. Some studies have shown those wildfires are one of the greatest threats to endangered and threatened bird species.\n",

      "Smoke lingered in the air outside a heritage building where a fire broke out earlier this week, as a small crowd stood behind police tape watching firefighters at work.\n",

      "Across the street, a makeshift memorial dedicated to the victims of the fire slowly grew as residents stopped by to drop bouquets of flowers.\n",

      "“Rest in peace my beautiful Charlie,” read a note left with pictures of a young woman. “You are in our hearts forever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Montreal fire officials said Saturday evening that at least seven people remained unaccounted for in the fire that also injured nine others and destroyed the three-storey building in the city’s historic district on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial reports said one person was missing after the blaze, but fire officials said information they received on Saturday suggested that number was higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The information confirmed in the last few hours, from various sources, allows us to believe that there may be victims inside the debris,” Montreal fire operations chief Martin Guilbault said Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guilbault told reporters that the building will be slowly taken down “stone by stone,” starting Sunday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police have not released the name of those missing, but Louis-Philippe Lacroix said his 18-year-old daughter, Charlie, was one of the victims trapped inside the Old Montreal building that housed an architectural firm and several residences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lacroix said his daughter was in an Airbnb with friends Thursday morning when the fire broke out. She and at least one friend made two calls to 911, he said, describing how they were trapped in a windowless apartment and could not escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Learning this news and having to announce it to my son and my loved ones is certainly the worst thing to experience as a parent,” Mr. Lacroix posted on social media. On Saturday, he came from Terrebonne, a suburb north of the city, with other family members to grieve for his daughter outside the building where she spent her last night.\n",

      "\n",
      "Police have said the cause of the fire remains unknown, and the investigation is being led by the Montreal police arson squad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The stories of the people on site here that are missing are just horrible,” said Alain Vaillancourt, a City of Montreal councillor responsible for public security. He said it was too early to draw conclusions about potential safety issues with the building. If there were any violations, he said, the city would act severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, the firefighters were unable to enter the building, which was deemed unsafe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police said there was some confusion over how many people were inside the building at the time of the fire because several apartments were Airbnb rentals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short-time rentals are not authorized in this part of the city unless it is the occasional rental of one’s principal residence.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Vaillancourt called on the province’s revenue agency to provide more resources to fight against illegal Airbnbs and other short-term rentals. He said the provincial agency has the power to impose heftier fines, while the city does not have enough inspectors to enforce the by-laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the city is also in touch with the Ministry of Culture so that everything would be done to save the William-Watson-Ogilvie building, which was built in 1890 and has a neo-Romanesque medieval character. However, he said, “the priority right now is to make sure that the building is secure, that the walls don’t fall because they still have to go and find potential victims inside.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s sad,” local resident André Rival said of the fire victims as he walked by the building, looking at the charred debris. It’s also “sad for the heritage to go away like that,” he added.\n",

      "\n",
      "Coaches don’t quit, but Antonio Conte is coming close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conte is the Italian manager of that famous coaching graveyard, Tottenham Hotspur. He was supposed to be the guy to push them over the top. Instead, the team has gotten hold of him by the ankle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conte is one of the dozen or so soccer coaches who are immune to failure. That’s not to say he never loses. It is to say that losing does not attach itself to him. He’s won enough that people have him pegged as a permanent winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the way of soccer, Conte also loses a lot of jobs. This is his fifth stop in 10 years. This season, Spurs are bumbling along. They’re not a bad team, but they’re not a good one either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conte’s probably getting fired again. No problem. He’ll have a new gig 10 minutes later.\n",
      "\n",
      "But befitting a man in his early 50s who’s had enough of this merry-go-round, Conte decided to quit first. Sort of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years ago, I also had a job I hated. One day, as a purgative exercise, I wrote out all of my grievances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stamps and envelopes were free in the supply room. I intended to mail this j’accuse to a friend overseas. But the printer was broken. I kept hitting ‘send’ and getting an error message. So, like any budding professional genius, I gave up and went home.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I arrived back at work the next day, the letter was taped to my computer monitor. I sat there all morning while my colleagues avoided looking at me. I phoned a lawyer friend and asked him what to do. He said that I was not under any circumstances to leave. If I wanted to ensure that I got paid what I was owed, they had to make the first move.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I sat there well into the afternoon. It was getting onto two o’clock. This was beginning to seriously cut into my post-job-loss drinking binge. Finally, I stood at my cubicle, held up my hand to summon everyone’s attention and asked, “Is someone going to fire me or what?” So they did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask you – was I fired? Or did I quit via firing? If it’s between being the schmuck who had something done to him or the even bigger schmuck who took action, I choose the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conte’s version of writing a letter (minus the part about forgetting to delete it from the print queue) was answering a question. It wasn’t much of a question – “Why do you think it’s like this?” – but it came after Spurs coughed up a certain win in the final minutes of a match last weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” Conte said incredulously, and then made that particular Italian sound you know if you’ve ever asked a Roman in a hurry how to get to the Spanish Steps – “ … Bah!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Conte launched into a broadside against the club (“They are used to [losing] here”), his players (“They don’t want to play under pressure”), management (“Until now I try to hide this situation, but now, no”) and ownership (“Twenty years, there is this owner, and they never won something”).\n",
      "\n",
      "Italian soccer managers in a mood do angry rants better than anyone anywhere. This was a real standout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conte’s position in the club has become untenable. But as of Tuesday afternoon, he still had a job. Every hour that passes makes Spurs look more ridiculous, and makes Conte look more right. If you can’t get rid of a guy who just told you to your face that he hates working for you, what else are you doing wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "However this ends, Conte’s reputation won’t suffer. In fact, he may have done it some good. Right now, he’s not a guy who couldn’t the job done. He’s an iconoclast who spoke truth to power.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a lesson North American coaches might meditate on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty years ago, it made sense to stay in a bad job for as long as possible. Coaches made much less money. Showing up one team could get you blackballed by all the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those factors no longer apply. Coaches are paid like players. Since there are no original thinkers in sports, the same people keep getting all the same jobs. Peter Laviolette has coached five NHL teams. Ken Hitchcock had six top jobs. Darryl Sutter is on a mission to coach every team in the league.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these guys want to call it a day on one job, current employment patterns suggest they won’t have trouble finding another.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hear what you’re saying – quitters never win, stand and fight, you don’t make it in sports unless you have that do-or-die attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad news: Regardless of how vigorous your attitude is, you’re going to die. Coaching is the only profession in which you are guaranteed to be fired. Once you have begun to invoke your never-say-die attitude, someone is coming up behind you with a metaphoric axe.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be wonderful if just once in the midst of a season in which a club has blown three-quarters of its games and misplaced the team charter, a coach said, ‘You know what? This isn’t working. I’ve tried my best, but no dice. So I’m Audi 5000. Hasta la vista, suckers.’\n",
      "\n",
      "And then left.\n",
      "\n",
      "This imaginary hero doesn’t quibble about the money or try to justify himself. He just leaves. It’s not like anything would stop running. As jobs go, coaching sports involves very little actual work.\n",
      "\n",
      "An assistant takes over and gets some exposure, the team saves money and the fans have something to talk about. Everyone’s a winner. Why would anyone be angry about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "A coach who quit in a huff would become a legend. Theoretically.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can think of about a hundred coaches (and executives) who should have done that, but stayed around another six months so that their partial humiliation could become total, then lost their jobs anyway. Most of them were in charge of the Leafs. Now that it’s over, I wonder if they’d do it the same way again.\n"

Flowers and messages are shown at a makeshift memorial near the site of the building on March 23.Graham Hughes\n",
      "\n",
      "As firefighters continue to search for victims in the charred remains of an apartment building in Old Montreal, after a blaze last week that killed at least four and left three missing, short-term rental company Airbnb said Friday it would pull listings in Quebec that don’t have permits from the provincial government.\n",
      "\n",
      "But questions remain about the role of illegal short-term rentals in the tragedy. Police have confirmed the historic building contained unlicensed Airbnbs. In 2018, short-term rentals were banned in the area where the building is located. Earlier in the week, the Quebec government said it plans to introduce new legislation to crack down on illegal rental listings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexandre Bergevin, a lawyer for Emile-Haim Benamor, the owner of the building, said last week that Airbnb rentals in the Old Montreal property were not being operated by his client. He added that the building’s fire alarm system had been replaced in 2019 and was regularly tested, and that its layout and exits had been “deemed compliant” in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Family members and friends of those believed to have been killed in the fire are now anxiously awaiting news about their loved ones. Investigators have turned to dental records and DNA testing to identify three of four bodies already recovered. The fourth, Camille Maheux, a 76-year-old photographer, is the only one to have been publicly identified by police.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis-Phillippe Lacroix, who believes his 18-year-old daughter Charlie was among the victims, is still waiting for answers. “Every day we learn … something a little more shocking,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie and at least one friend made 911 calls on March 16, when the fire broke out, saying they were trapped in a windowless apartment and could not escape, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Globe and Mail previously spoke with Eve-Marie Morin, a woman who said she had stayed in an Airbnb in the building in December, 2020. She said her unit had no windows. Survivors of last week’s blaze have said the building’s fire alarms did not work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We literally woke up to the sound of fire,” Alina Kuzmina, one of the survivors, said last weekend. She and her husband escaped from their Airbnb rental, which was located in the building’s basement.\n",

      "In a letter Friday to Quebec Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx, Airbnb said that it would remove listings across the province that don’t have required permits from the agency that manages the province’s tourist accommodation act. It also said that in the coming days it will require new listings to include their permit numbers. The company also promised to give the provincial government access to the Airbnb City Portal, a tool it says helps communities enforce rules and understand Airbnb’s local footprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These measures build on our years-long efforts to work with local and provincial officials on short-term rental rules that help address community concerns and also preserve a vital source of supplemental income for residents,” the company wrote.\n",

      "The letter was signed by Nathan Rotman, Airbnb’s representative for Canada and the northeastern United States. He was one of two employees of the company who met Thursday in Quebec City with Ms. Proulx.\n",

      "Ms. Proulx said in a statement after the meeting that she had made clear to the Airbnb representatives that she was determined to tighten the rules surrounding rentals, and to make shared-accommodation platforms more accountable. She also vowed to revise the law by June 9 to ensure listings include their permit numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement shared Friday by her spokesperson, Ms. Proulx said she was pleased with Airbnb’s measures. “I am satisfied with Airbnb’s decision to comply with our legislation as I demanded yesterday during our meeting,” Ms. Proulx said.\n",

      "Mr. Benamor, the building owner, has had multiple files opened with the Tribunal administratif du logement (TAL), which arbitrates disputes between landlords and tenants in Quebec. While most of the disputes were about rent increases, many also show Mr. Benamor trying to terminate leases and evict tenants from the Old Montreal building, which contained 14 residential units.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one 2012 decision, Mr. Benamor and an insurance broker from Lloyd’s, Michel Frigon, argued that the building was at a high risk of fire because of outdated electrical wiring and work they alleged a tenant had done. The tribunal dismissed the allegation for lack of proof and reminded the landlord that it was his responsibility to make sure the building was up to code.\n",

      "\n",
      "During the visit to the property, which is located on Notre-Dame Street, an inspector tested the fire escape. The cable suspending it in the air suddenly snapped, plunging the structure and the inspector to the ground, where he suffered a broken ankle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Benamor was charged with failing to have an emergency exit maintained in adequate condition. He was acquitted last year because there wasn’t enough proof he had failed to show diligence in addressing the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2023 civil lawsuit by the City of Westmount – a separate municipality within Montreal – accuses Mr. Benamor of maintaining unsanitary conditions in another apartment building, this one located on St-Antoine Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "A former tenant, Alonso Martinez Pena, said Mr. Benamor screwed the building’s back door shut at one point, which left him feeling worried about the availability of safe exits in the event of fire. The screws had been removed when The Globe visited, leaving visible holes.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The bodies of the final two missing victims of a fire in Old Montreal were pulled from the rubble on Monday, as investigators shifted their attention to uncovering the causes of the deadly blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total number of people killed in the March 16 fire sits at seven, and fire operations chief Martin Guilbault said there was no reason to believe anyone else was inside the charred building.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At this stage of the investigation, we can reaffirm that, apart from the seven people who were initially missing, we have no information indicating that additional victims are in the rubble,” he told reporter at the scene. “Our effort will now focus on finding the cause of the fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Montreal police Inspector David Shane on Monday identified four victims as An Wu, 31; Dania Zafar, 31; Saniya Khan, 31; and Nathan Sears, 35. Another victim – 76-year-old photographer Camille Maheux – was identified last week. The remains of the final two victims would be sent to a lab to be formally identified, Insp. Shane said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Guilbault said the fire department was able to secure the structure last Friday, which allowed a more thorough search of the building over the weekend. The two victims were located Monday with the help of volunteer dog handlers from a search-and-rescue organization, who combed the rubble with the help of a border collie and a German shepherd.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the dogs will continue to search to ensure there are no more victims, Mr. Guilbault said investigators will shift their focus to honing in on the cause of the fire. That’s largely a process of elimination that involves ruling out potential causes one by one, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The building’s historic façade will likely not need to be dismantled, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insp. Shane said that while some fires are criminal in origin, most are accidental. Investigators “start large” and look at every possibility, then narrow down the causes, he said. While criminal causes such as arson or negligence are considered, he said most fires are “involuntary,” with causes such as cigarettes or that originate in kitchens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody has been charged in relation to the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Guilbault confirmed Monday that police officers had been dispatched Friday to at least one other building belonging to Emile-Haim Benamor, the owner of the building that caught fire. Police said the officers were there for about seven hours. Mr. Guilbault did not specify exactly why the officers were sent, but he said it’s not uncommon for the fire department to call on the police to help protect and secure a building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of those missing in the fire had rented their accommodations on Airbnb, which is illegal to use in that part of the city. The tragedy prompted the short-term rental platform to announce last week that it would pull listings in Quebec that don’t have a permit from the provincial government\n",
      "\n",
      "The confirmed victims of the fire include Ms. Wu, a neuroscientist doing postdoctoral work at the University of California San Diego, who was in Montreal for a conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Zafar and Ms. Khan, who were friends from Toronto and Detroit, were staying in the building during a brief holiday in the city, Ms. Zafar’s father has said. Zafar Mahmood has described his daughter, who was self-employed and working in publishing in Toronto, as a free spirit who loved art, books and heritage, and who was in the process of getting Canadian citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Sears was a political scientist from Toronto, who was listed as having taken part in the International Studies Association conference held in Montreal the week of the fire. “We are all devastated,” University of Toronto professor Steven Bernstein, who was Mr. Sears’s PhD thesis supervisor, wrote in an e-mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Maheux was a long-time resident of the building and a renowned photographer whose works have been featured by the National Gallery of Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie Lacroix, an 18-year-old from the Montreal suburb of Terrebonne, is believed to be one of the two unidentified victims. She had rented a unit in the building on Airbnb with a friend, and Ms. Lacroix’s father has said his daughter told 911 operators that she was trapped in a unit with no fire escape or windows.\n"

      "After migrants in northern Mexico placed mattresses against the bars of their detention cell and set them on fire, guards quickly walked away and made no apparent attempt to release the men before smoke filled the room and killed at least 40, surveillance video showed Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hours after the fire broke out late Monday, rows of bodies were laid out under shimmery silver sheets outside the immigration detention facility in Ciudad Juarez, which is across the U.S. border from El Paso, Texas, and a major crossing point for migrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-nine people were injured and were in “delicate-serious” condition, according to the National Immigration Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of the blaze, 68 men from Central and South America were being held at the facility, the agency said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the video, two people dressed as guards rush into the camera frame, and at least one migrant appears by the metal gate on the other side. But the guards did not appear to make any effort to open the cell doors and instead ran away as billowing clouds of smoke filled the structure within seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adan Augusto Lopez, Mexico’s interior secretary, confirmed the authenticity of the video in an interview with local journalist Joaquin Lopez Doriga.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immigration authorities identified the dead and injured as being from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, according to a statement from the Mexican attorney-general’s office. Guatemala Foreign Affairs Minister Mario Bucaro said 28 of the dead were Guatemalan citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the fire was started by migrants in protest after learning they would be deported.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They never imagined that this would cause this terrible misfortune,” Mr. Lopez Obrador said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deaths forced the government to rent refrigerated trailers to hold the migrants’ bodies, Chihuahua state prosecutor Cesar Jauregui told reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The detention facility is across the street from Juarez’s city hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a nearby hospital, Viangly Infante Padron, a 31-year-old Venezuelan migrant seeking asylum in the U.S. with her husband and three children, waited for her husband, who was being treated for smoke inhalation. The previous evening, she was waiting outside the detention centre for his release when the fire broke out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was smoke everywhere. The ones they let out were the women, and those [employees] with immigration,” she said. “The men, they never took them out until the firefighters arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw several dead bodies before finding her husband in an ambulance. “I was desperate because I saw a dead body, a body, a body, and I didn’t see him anywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, about 100 migrants gathered Tuesday outside the immigration facility’s doors to demand information about relatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katiuska Marquez, a 23-year-old Venezuelan woman with her two children, ages 2 and 4, was seeking her half-brother, Orlando Maldonado, who had been travelling with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want to know if he is alive or if he’s dead,” she said. She wondered how all the guards who were inside made it out alive and only the migrants died. “How could they not get them out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities did not immediately answer that question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Marquez and Mr. Maldonado were detained Monday with the children and about 20 others. They had been in Juarez waiting for an appointment from U.S. authorities to request asylum. They were staying in a rented room where 10 people were living, paying for it with the money they begged in the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was at a stoplight with a piece of cardboard asking for what I needed for my children, and people were helping me with food,” she said. Suddenly agents came and detained everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone was taken to the immigration facility but only the men were placed in the cells. Three hours later, the women and children were released.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tensions between authorities and migrants had apparently been running high in recent weeks in Ciudad Juarez, where shelters are full of people waiting for opportunities to cross into the U.S. or for the asylum process to play out.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 30 migrant shelters and other advocacy organizations published an open letter on March 9 that complained of a criminalization of migrants and asylum seekers in the city. It accused authorities of abusing migrants and using excessive force in rounding them up, including complaints that municipal police questioned people in the street about their immigration status without cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high level of frustration in Ciudad Juarez was evident earlier this month when hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants tried to force their way across one of the international bridges to El Paso, acting on false rumours that the United States would allow them to enter the country. U.S. authorities blocked their attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, Juarez Mayor Cruz Perez Cuellar started campaigning to inform migrants there was room in shelters and no need to beg in the streets. He urged residents not to give money to them and said authorities would remove them from intersections where it was dangerous to beg and allegedly a nuisance to residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Migrant advocates who recently denounced more aggressive tactics said Tuesday that the immigration facility was over capacity and that the site of the fire was small and lacked ventilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You could see it coming,” the advocates’ statement said. “Mexico’s immigration policy kills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The national immigration agency said Tuesday that it “energetically rejects the actions that led to this tragedy” without any further explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “extensive use of immigration detention leads to tragedies like this one,” Felipe Gonzalez Morales, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights of migrants, said via Twitter. In keeping with international law, immigration detention should be an exceptional measure and not generalized, he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexico’s immigration lockups have seen overcrowding, protests and riots from time to time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October, a group of mostly Venezuelan migrants rioted inside an immigration centre in Tijuana. In November, dozens of migrants rioted in Mexico’s largest detention centre in the southern city of Tapachula near the border with Guatemala. No one died in either incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexico has emerged as the world’s third most popular destination for asylum-seekers, after the United States and Germany. But it is still largely a country that migrants pass through on their way to the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asylum-seekers must stay in the state where they apply in Mexico, resulting in large numbers being holed up near the country’s southern border with Guatemala. Tens of thousands are also in border cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a Mass celebrated in memory of the migrants, Bishop Jose Guadalupe Torres Campos lamented the sudden grief that had descended upon the migrant community.\n",
      "\n",

      "In New York, a tenant first reports heat and water issues to their landlord, and if the landlord is not responsive they can file a complaint to the city.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Israeli military struck targets in the Gaza Strip early Friday, pushing the region closer toward a wider conflagration after a day of rocket fire along the country’s northern and southern borders following two days of unrest at Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least two loud explosions could be heard in Gaza. It was not immediately clear what was struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air strikes came after militants in Lebanon fired a heavy barrage of rockets at Israel earlier in the day, forcing people across Israel’s northern frontier into bomb shelters, wounding at least two people. In Gaza, militants also fired rockets toward Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli military officials said the rocket fire on both fronts was carried out by Palestinian militants in connection to this week’s violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the heart of Jerusalem’s Old City, where Israeli police stormed into the building with tear gas and stun grenades on two straight days. The violent scenes from the mosque have ratched up tensions across the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "The air strikes came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was meeting with his Security Cabinet to discuss the rocket fire. He vowed an “aggressive response.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will strike our enemies and they will pay a price for every act of aggression,” he said, adding that Israelis remain united in the face of external threats despite their political differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no immediate Israeli response in Lebanon, where militants fired some 34 rockets across the border. The military said 25 were shot down by its Iron Dome aerial defence system. Five rockets struck Israeli territory and the rest of the strikes were being investigated. Israel said two people were wounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unusually large salvo of rockets raised fears of a wider conflagration, as Israel’s bitter enemy, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, holds sway over much of southern Lebanon. Over the past two days, tensions have skyrocketed at the sacred compound home to the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and along Israel’s tense border with Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a briefing with reporters, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said the army drew a clear connection between the Lebanese rocket fire and the recent unrest in Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a Palestinian-oriented event,” he said, adding that either the Hamas or Islamic Jihad militant groups, which are based in Gaza but also operate in Lebanon, could be involved. But he said the army believed that Hezbollah and the Lebanese government were aware of what happened and also held responsibility. He declined to say how Israel might respond, saying there were “all sorts of scenarios.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier on Thursday and late Wednesday night, Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired several rockets toward Israel in protest over the Israeli police storming into the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the heart of Jerusalem’s Old City with tear gas and stun grenades. On Thursday, Hezbollah condemned Israel’s storming of Al-Aqsa. The shrine – the third-holiest site in Islam – stands on a hilltop revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism.\n",
      "\n",
      "No faction in Lebanon claimed responsibility for the salvo of rockets, which set off air raid sirens across the country’s north.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Lebanese security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media, said the country’s security forces believed the rockets were launched by a Lebanon-based Palestinian militant group, not by Hezbollah militants. The official said there were no casualties on the Lebanese side.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for Hezbollah did not respond to a request for comment. Both Israel and Hezbollah have avoided an all-out conflict since a 34-day war in 2006 ended with a draw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tensions have simmered along the Lebanese border as Israel appears to have ratcheted up its shadow war against Iranian-linked targets in Syria, another close ally of Iran, Israel’s arch-enemy in the region. Suspected Israeli air strikes in Syria in recent weeks have killed two Iranian military advisers and temporarily put the country’s two largest airports out of service. Hecht said Thursday’s rocket fire was not believed to be connected to events in Syria.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Washington, Principal Deputy State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said, “Israel has legitimate security concerns and has every right to defend themselves. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he also urged calm in Jerusalem. “We emphasize the importance of upholding the historic status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem and any unilateral action that jeopardizes the status quo to us is unacceptable,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Israel, Thursday’s rocket fire from Lebanon sent shrapnel flying that wounded at least two people, according to the Galilee Medical Center. Israeli police said a bomb squad removed a number of fragments from areas in the north.\n",
      "\n",
      "Videos on social media showed huge plumes of dark smoke billowing from Israel’s northern hills and streaks through the sky left by the Iron Dome defence system. Widely circulated photos showed shrapnel that punched a hole in a street in the northern Israeli town of Shlomi and at least one building with its windows blown out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lebanese army said it found missile launchers and “a number of rockets intended for launch” in the vicinity of the towns of Zibqin and Qalila in south Lebanon and was working to dismantle them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad hailed the rockets as “a heroic operation against the Israeli crimes in the Al-Aqsa Mosque.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, is visiting Lebanon, where he met with exiled leaders of Palestinian militant groups late Thursday. “Our Palestinian people will not remain passive towards the ongoing aggression,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Jerusalem, tensions ran high after two nights of unrest. Conflicting claims over the sacred compound home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque have spiralled into violence in the past, including a bloody 11-day war in 2021 between Israel and Hamas.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the past two nights – a volatile time during which the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover overlap – Palestinians have barricaded themselves in the mosque with stones and firecrackers. Worshippers have been demanding the right to pray overnight inside the mosque – which authorities typically only permit during the last 10 days of the month-long holiday. They also have stayed in the mosque in protest over threats by religious Jews to carry out a ritual animal slaughter at the sacred site for Passover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel bars ritual slaughter on the site, but calls by Jewish extremists to revive the practice, including offers of cash rewards to anyone who even attempts to bring an animal into the compound, have amplified fears among Muslims that Israel is plotting to take over the site\n",
      "\n",
      "Early Wednesday, Israeli police raided the mosque, firing stun grenades and rubber bullets to evict worshippers who had locked the doors of the building. Palestinians hurled stones and fireworks at officers. After a few hours of scuffles that left a trail of damage, police managed to drag everyone out of the compound. Police fiercely beat Palestinians and arrested over 400 people. Israeli authorities control access to the area but the compound is administered by Islamic and Jordanian officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The violence at the site has resonated across the region, with condemnations pouring in from Muslim leaders.\n"

      "\n",
      "Show Caption Hide Caption Drone footage captures landfill fire burning in Alabama The EPA stepped in to help Alabama with a landfill fire that has burned for months. Storyful\n",
      "\n",
      "An underground landfill fire in Alabama has burned for more than four months, polluting the air for miles and sickening people and animals. For weeks, state and local authorities did little to stop it, instead bickering over their responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The site, intended to collect grass clippings and tree branches and other such waste, has been a problem for years, with state inspectors at least twice urging its private management company to close down the landfill. Yet it continued to function as a dumping ground for unsanctioned and flammable materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alabama eventually called in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, conceding it needed help with the fire. Now that it is essentially out, as of this week, the state will soon be on its own again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fix it': Residents affected by Alabama landfill fire launch protest at the State House\n",
      "\n",
      "Three months on: Alabama landfill fire is still burning\n",
      "\n",
      "Alabama set up a working group to address the many concerns angry area residents – some of whom live just 100 yards from the 16 1/2-acre landfill – have raised about how the fire was handled. Some have filed suit over the site, which Alabama authorities allowed to operate without a permit even as it racked violations over its operations, before ultimately exposing tens of thousands of people to toxins since the fire ignited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Landfill fires are common; the one in Alabama was unusual\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a months-long fire at a dump is unusual, landfill fires are more common than most Americans likely realize, usually the result of heat buildup from decomposing garbage bursting into flames. Hundreds of blazes occur annually at waste sites, according to a federal database of fire incidents. But they rarely burn for more than a day, a USA TODAY analysis of the data found.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Landfill fires occur at different scales across the country, at a frequency people may not be aware of, because they don’t get publicized,” said Matthew Huyser, the EPA's on-scene coordinator in Alabama. “Most of the times, they’re dealt with by the facility or by the (fire) department, if necessary. They can be addressed or extinguished rather quickly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These fires don't typically occur spontaneously unless the landfill isn't properly \"capped,\" or covered with compacted soil, to ensure that the layers of decomposing waste aren't exposed to oxygen. It's the presence of oxygen that allows for flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "While most large landfills taking household trash require maintaining a soil cap, \"this particular site is different because the state regulations did not require that,\" Huyser said.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's because the site wasn't operating as a construction debris or a municipal waste landfill. Instead, the site run by Environmental Landfill, Inc. was meant for disposing vegetation, Huyser said, which does not require a cap in Alabama.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the state's own records show the site was repeatedly used to dump construction debris, tires and other non-vegetative waste. And in the months since the fire broke out, the EPA has found enough construction demolition debris on the surface of the landfill to fill roughly three dump trucks – including scrap metal, wiring, chain-link fence, plastic, a metal beam and fence post, tire pieces and other rubbish – which it plans to transport to an approved landfill, said Subash Patel, another on-scene coordinator with the EPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those things should not have been disposed on the site,\" Huyser said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), however, noted that the cause of the fire has not been determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spokeswoman Lynn Battle said added that the state agency \"does not have authority to regulate vegetative waste sites, and land use decisions are decided by local government, such as the county, not ADEM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The owners of Environmental Landfill, Inc. and their attorney did not respond to multiple emails, phone calls or text messages requesting comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "More: Justice Department sues Louisiana chemical company over high cancer risk to majority-Black community\n",
      "\n",
      "A history of violations\n",
      "\n",
      "The landfill, however, was hardly unfamiliar to the state agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The site, roughly 20 miles northeast of Birmingham, has been dinged for violations by ADEM in the past, going back nearly a decade, according to a USA TODAY review of the environmental agency's online records database.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far back as November 2013, an ADEM inspector found unauthorized solid waste dumped at the landfill, including construction demolition waste, scrap tires and shingles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The disposal site does not meet the minimum requirements for a landfill unit, has not obtained a landfill permit from the department, and therefore is an unauthorized dump,\" the state's environmental agency wrote in a December 2013 letter to the landfill's owner. The agency urged the closure of the site and asked the owner to submit a written cleanup plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar letter was sent to the landfill's owner in 2018, citing the discovery of \"construction and demolition waste, scrap tires, scrap metal and petroleum contaminated soil\" and asking for a \"site closure plan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2020 inspection report yet again flagged similar types of trash and construction debris, such as \"construction demolition waste,\" as well as \"creosote coated power poles and pallets.\" The wood preservative creosote is highly combustible and the EPA recommends it not be burned in a residential setting to keep people from inhaling toxic chemicals in smoke and ash. By August 2022, the last inspection before the November fire broke out, an ADEM inspector said the poles and pallets had been removed and taken to the appropriate landfills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the inspector noted that \"tree waste was primarily observed on-site, with very little construction demolition waste observed in piles on top of tree waste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmental attorney David Ludder, who served as ADEM’s general counsel in the 1980s, said the state agency has misread state statute in concluding green waste landfills don't need to be permitted, unlike other landfills.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My analysis of the statute, which ADEM operates under, says precisely that they are supposed to regulate that disposal,\" Ludder said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ludder called the landfill fire \"one of the top failures of the agency.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"ADEM has known for years that there has been other waste mixed in with the vegetative waste, but their actions have been ineffective,\" Ludder said. \"I think the most they've done is issue a notice of violation to the company. It's basically a request for voluntary compliance. It doesn't require them to comply. It doesn't impose a mandatory duty to comply. it doesn't impose any penalties for noncompliance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And if the landfill continued to accept unauthorized materials, they should have been forced to obtain a permit under ADEM's existing interpretation of the statute, said Michael Hansen, executive director at the Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution, or GASP.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, ADEM Director Lance LeFleur told the state's Environmental Management Commission that the fire had \"exposed shortcomings\" in the ability of state and local governments to respond to such situations that pose a risk to the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "LeFleur said \"ADEM will investigate and take appropriate enforcement action against the site operator after the fire is out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Where will you find 'forever chemicals'? Everywhere, new analysis suggests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawsuits allege negligence\n",
      "\n",
      "Two lawsuits have been filed in the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Alabama, alleging that Environmental Landfill, Inc., and its owners were negligent in their operation of the landfill, among other issues. One of the lawsuits is a class-action complaint; the other lawsuit also names LeFleur in his official and individual capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tens of thousands of people were exposed to harmful levels of toxic air pollution as state and local agencies spent weeks pointing fingers at each other, trying to determine who was supposed to do what, Hansen said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Initially, ADEM simply issued a couple of statements and passed the buck elsewhere,\" Hansen said. \"They offered no real guidance to the impacted residents looking for answers and action. Gov. Kay Ivey did nothing up until the very last minute when she finally declared a state of emergency.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ivey, a Republican, declared a limited state of emergency in January, allowing local firefighters to intervene on private property and so she could ask the U.S. EPA for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emergency declared: Ivey calls on EPA to fight landfill fire raging in Alabama\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, residents have reported headaches, coughing, wheezing, nausea, nose bleeds, vomiting, eye and throat irritation, rashes, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing and more, Hansen said. Outdoor animals including dogs showed signs of distress and had to be brought indoors, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, the state created a working group to examine \"shortcomings\" in how the state and local governments responded to the fire. The group is expected to make recommendations on whether changes to state law or additional resources are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA plans to have a team available with a water truck and excavator at the site if needed for roughly two more weeks and the state and county are expected to take the lead around mid-April, the EPA's Patel said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the landfill itself, it's unclear if it will ever be reopened for vegetative waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm hoping ADEM, the county, and the owner will reach an agreement where there will be no further action at the landfill,\" Patel said. \"It will be up to those three parties to decide how they want to move forward.\"\n",

      "['Maureen Dowd'] 2023-04-08 00:00:00 Despite Kavanagh’s reticence, there may be some clues to what that game is. Gala wrote a public letter in 2011 complaining that “the frenzy to diversify” the department would cause “future ruination.” The New York Daily News reported that as Queens borough commander, Schaaf resisted disciplining some firefighters after allegations of racism at one of his firehouses. The paper also reported that Jardin was the subject of a series of complaints with the city’s Office of Equal Employment Opportunity over his management style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Days after the demotions, John Hodgens, the five-star chief of department and its highest-ranking uniformed official, and John Esposito, the chief of fire operations, asked to be demoted to Civil Service ranks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allies of Hodgens and Esposito — union representatives said the two men declined to be interviewed — told me the chiefs felt humiliated because they learned about the demotions only when one of the demoted men texted someone at the big meeting with Kavanagh, after she had left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hodgens, in particular, is a surprising adversary, since he had at times supported Kavanagh’s quest for the top job, and Kavanagh promoted both men to their current posts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further inflaming matters, someone taped the meeting and leaked it to The Daily News — a breach of department protocols that is being investigated. On the tape, the paper reported, Kavanagh can be heard complaining that she had gotten little response to her requests for innovative suggestions, while chiefs can be heard asking about vacation time and the use of personal cars — making them look like entitled crybabies and the commissioner look like a forward-looking leader. A lawsuit from three chiefs, two of whom Kavanagh demoted, accuses her camp of leaking the tape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, seven staff chiefs have joined Hodgens and Esposito in solidarity, asking to be demoted. Kavanagh, trying to steady the ship, has not approved any of the requests.\n",

      "James McCarthy, the president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, which represents officers above the rank and file, said the uprising is not waning. He said the chiefs and deputy chiefs involved do not see themselves as mutineers but more as principled resisters, “like Archibald Cox” during Watergate.\n"

The vessel was reported to have an estimated 55,000 gallons of diesel and 19,000 pounds of Freon, a noncombustible gas commonly used as a refrigerant. The Tacoma Fire Department had told residents of northeast Tacoma, and the neighborhoods of Browns Point and Dash Point, to remain indoors.\n",

      "\n",
      "Like a lot of Toronto Raptors fans, Masai Ujiri didn’t like what he saw from his team this season. But as team president, he could do something about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Head coach Nick Nurse was fired by the Raptors on Friday after a disappointing season where Toronto failed to make the playoffs and finished ninth in the Eastern Conference with a 41-41 record, losing to the Chicago Bulls in the NBA play-in tournament.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ujiri addressed media about an hour after the Raptors announced Nurse’s dismissal. Visibly choked up after firing the coach who guided Toronto to its only NBA championship, Ujiri made no excuses during a 45-minute news conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe that we’re going to win again in Toronto, and I feel strongly about that, but to watch us play this year was not us,” said Ujiri at OVO Centre, the Raptors training facility. “I did not enjoy watching this team play and I think that spoke loud and clear to everything that I think went on this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It bothered all of us. It bothered coach too. But sometimes we have to make changes and we have to move forward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Opinion: Right at his tenure’s end, Nick Nurse has picked a fight\n",
      "\n",
      "Nurse joined the Raptors organization in 2013 as an assistant coach before being named the ninth head coach in team history in June 2018, replacing Dwane Casey.\n",
      "\n",
      "He coached the Raptors to their first NBA title the following year, defeating Orlando, Philadelphia and Milwaukee before topping the Golden State Warriors in the final.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his five seasons as head coach, Nurse had the best winning percentage in Raptors history with a 227-163 record. But Ujiri noticed that Toronto’s winning culture had somehow soured at the start of the 2022-23 season, particularly following ugly losses in New Orleans and Brooklyn on Nov. 30 and Dec. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s something there that did not seem right at all and from there it started taking a turn,” said Ujiri. “But when you’re in a season you hope, you know? You want to do better, you see signs, it just was tough from there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to reports, former Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka is a replacement Toronto could consider. Udoka was suspended this season for an inappropriate relationship with a Celtics team staffer. Udoke helped Boston reach the NBA Finals last season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ujiri, however, said the Raptors still had to evaluate the past season before beginning their search for a new head coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re going to go into that right after we get through this,” he said. “It’s going to be a lot of conversations, just internally talking to (general manager Bobby Webster) and the crew and some of the things we’re going to be obviously looking at are the roster and the fits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Toronto’s shaky play this season led to media speculation that Nurse, whose contract was set to expire after next season, would either quit or be fired. Some reports also suggested that a rift had formed between him and Ujiri.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speculation about Nurse’s future came to a head on March 31 in Philadelphia when he said in a postgame conference that he would have to think about his future in the off-season. Three days later in Charlotte, Nurse was asked by a reporter about those comments and he gave a terse reply, insisting on only focusing on this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nurse defended those comments at this end-of-season news conference on April 13, saying that he was trying to be proactive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The speculation of whether I was going to be back or not that started, I have no idea where that comes from or what I was supposed to do about that,” said Nurse. “I needed to try to get the team or any of the players focused back on the job at hand and try to not have to answer that question every game.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ujiri addressed that imbroglio on Friday, characterizing it as a lapse in judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I’d lose my mind if I had to talk to you guys every day,” Ujiri said, drawing a round of laughter from reporters. “I think that maybe possibly Nick made a mistake that day. I didn’t use it in this whole process at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For me, the timing was not great but (...) I’m not going to use that against him. He knows that. It was a mistake and we all moved on from it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Media reports suggest Nurse will be in the running to fill other NBA head coaching vacancies. In the meantime, he remains the head coach of the Canadian national team, a role he has held since June 2019. He signed a contract extension two years later that runs through the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n"

      "\n",
      "If the lone championship banner that ends with 19 instead of starting with those two digits wasn’t enough of a differentiator, another characteristic separating Scotiabank Arena’s two principal tenants was laid bare Friday morning in Toronto.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Maple Leafs were busy slapping themselves on the back after a job well done Thursday night – simultaneously crossing every available appendage in the hopes that the fourth time is the charm for head coach Sheldon Keefe – Raptors president Masai Ujiri simply decided to stop trying to redefine insanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, four years after Nick Nurse led the Raptors out of the parochial confines of Jurassic Park and all the way to the summit of the NBA as world champions, the most successful head coach in the franchise’s 28-year history was out of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re about winning here,” Ujiri said Friday, having watched his team go a whole three seasons without a playoff series victory. “We’ve not only said it, we’ve at least tried to do it, and that’s where we are going to continue to go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The team president pulled few punches when asked why now was the right time for the divorce, with Nurse reportedly having one year left on his deal. The way the season ended, with the team turning a 19-point third-quarter lead into a four-point loss to the Chicago Bulls in the play-in, left more than simply a sour taste in Ujiri’s mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that game summed up what has gone on in this organization,” he said. “The feel, the spirit of who we really are, it’s been very disappointing for us and we want to gain momentum back as a team.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The manner of that home loss to the Bulls put an exclamation point on Nurse’s second playoff-less campaign since winning the first championship in team history. In five seasons at the helm, the Iowa native went 227-163 for the best winning percentage in team history, earning the 2019-20 NBA coach-of-the-year award along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in going 41-41 this season, Ujiri said the team lacked the togetherness, spirit, and team culture that defined the Raptors as a championship club. In addition, he said that some of the younger players on the roster failed to take the step forward that the front office was expecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, most damningly, for someone who can have not just the best seats in the house, but gets paid to sit in them, Ujiri added that watching his team had started to become something of a chore.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe that we’re going to win again in Toronto, and I feel strongly about that, but to watch us play this year was not us,” he said. “I did not enjoy watching this team play and I think that spoke loud and clear to everything that I think went on this year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Raptors president said that he felt something wasn’t right with his team around the time it experienced back-to-back losses in Brooklyn and New Orleans, in late November and early December. And though Nurse ruffled some feathers with his outburst questioning his future with the team following a loss in Philadelphia at the end of last month, Ujiri said he didn’t hold it against him when weighing Nurse’s future.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For me, the timing was not great but … I’m not going to use that against him,” he said. “He knows that. It was a mistake and we all moved on from it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Nurse remains head coach of Team Canada, with a contract that runs through next year’s Paris Olympics, he may not be out of work for long. Media reports have already linked him with the vacant job with the Houston Rockets, for whom he once coached their G-League franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Raptors will now search for the 10th head coach in franchise history, with Ujiri saying that the team plans to have somebody in place by the NBA draft on June 22. ESPN is reporting that former Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka will likely get serious consideration for the role, with Udoka and Ujiri having maintained a long friendship.\n",
      "\n",

      "Caught in the middle are Black smokers, who smoke menthol cigarettes at higher rates than white smokers, and are the main group the ban is meant to help.

The companies have also funneled at least $135,000 since 2020 to a convenience-store trade group that is fighting the ban.\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite a slow, wet and cold rollout to spring in many parts of British Columbia, officials say the province is at a vulnerable juncture for forest fires, with out-of-control flames already forcing an evacuation before they were brought under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "BC Wildfire Service (BCWS) says spring grass fires are common at this time of year because the winter has left behind dry grasses, leaves and shrubs. New growth – which is less flammable – hasn’t been established yet. Spring wildfires generally happen in a window between snow retreat and around the months of May and June when there is significant rainfall, said Karley Desrosiers, information officer at the BCWS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dry grasses are susceptible to ignition, mainly in the windy valley bottoms. “And then with those winds once a fire has ignited, it can grow quite quickly. … So that’s what we’ve seen so far, primarily wind-driven grass fires.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, an early spring wildfire prompted an evacuation alert for the Ts’kw’aylaxw First Nation, near Lillooet, B.C. The fire grew to 20 hectares before it was contained by helicopter bucketing, a method of aerial firefighting where a collapsible bucket is suspended from a helicopter to release water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six people who had health issues were forced from the reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had two members who had to go to emergency because of the smoke,” said Donita Alec, receptionist at Ts’kw’aylaxw First Nation. Both members are better now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire is suspected to be caused by humans as most wildfires at this time of the year are, Ms. Desrosiers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Armel Castellan, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said despite lower than average temperatures this spring, March was unusually dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opinion: Spring is coming – where is our Canada Water Agency?\n",
      "\n",
      "Forecasters warn hot spell hikes risks of flooding, avalanches and fire across B.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m looking at November through till today, and I can see that a lot of locations are below 100 per cent, some as low as 50 or 55 per cent,” he said, making comparisons with the long-term rainfall average.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Mr. Castellan, this plays a role in how spring evolves, particularly the end of May and the month of June. “The atmosphere is the last chance to really deliver substantial amounts of rain in order to kind of keep the dryness at bay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If it continues to stay dry and warm into the start of summer, there is a higher possibility of seeing an early and more active start to the wildfire season, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Desrosiers said the severity of the wildfire season will depend on the amount and duration of rainfall in May and June. For now, it is too early to predict what the months of July and August would look like. As fuels begin to green up in the coming weeks, fire will likely decrease for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That being said, the risk doesn’t necessarily go away,” she said. There is usually a dip after a busy spring fire season, after which the fires pick up again when lightning strikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The timing of weather events is vastly unpredictable, Mr. Castellan said. Last month was recorded to be the second-hottest month globally, according to NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in 2021, B.C. witnessed 619 heat-related deaths as a result of the heat dome. “We had never seen heat like that at any time of year, let alone in June. … The wildfire season was on a complete tear from that moment on,” Mr. Castellan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So it really just takes one weather event to change the course of a wildfire season, beyond spring. … We can anticipate larger, more intense wildfires in future years and future decades.”\n"

      "\n",
      "Sudan’s army and its rival paramilitary said Sunday they will extend a humanitarian cease-fire a further 72 hours. The decision follows international pressure to allow the safe passage of civilians and aid but the shaky truce has not so far stopped the clashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In statements, both sides accused the other of violations. The agreement has deescalated the fighting in some areas but violence continues to push civilians to flee. Aid groups have also struggled to get badly needed supplies into the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict erupted on April 15 between the nation’s army and its paramilitary force, and threatens to thrust Sudan into a raging civil war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier Sunday, an aircraft carrying eight tons of emergency medical aid landed in Sudan to resupply hospitals devastated by the fighting, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which organized the shipment. It arrived as the civilian death toll from the countrywide violence topped 400.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than two-thirds of hospitals in areas with active fighting are out of service, a national doctors’ association has said, citing a shortage of medical supplies, health workers, water and electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supplies, including anesthetics, dressings, sutures and other surgical material, are enough to treat more than 1,000 people wounded in the conflict, the ICRC said. The aircraft took off earlier in the day from Jordan and safely landed in the city of Port Sudan, it said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The hope is to get this material to some of the most critically busy hospitals in the capital” of Khartoum and other hot spots, said Patrick Youssef, ICRC’s regional director for Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sudan Doctors’ Syndicate, which monitors casualties, said Sunday that over the past two weeks, 425 civilians were killed and 2,091 wounded. The Sudanese Health Ministry on Saturday put the overall death toll, including fighters, at 528, with 4,500 wounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the deadliest battles have raged across Khartoum. The fighting pits the army chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, against Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of a paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The generals, both with powerful foreign backers, were allies in an October 2021 military coup that halted Sudan’s fitful transition to democracy, but they have since turned on each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordinary Sudanese have been caught in the crossfire. Tens of thousands have fled to neighboring countries, including Chad and Egypt, while others remain pinned down with dwindling supplies. Thousands of foreigners have been evacuated in airlifts and land convoys.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, fighting continued in different parts of the capital where residents hiding in their homes reported hearing artillery fire. There have been lulls in fighting, but never a fully observed cease-fire, despite repeated attempts by international mediators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the weekend, residents reported that shops were reopening and normalcy gradually returning in some areas of Khartoum as the scale of fighting dwindled after yet another shaky truce. But in other areas, terrified residents reported explosions thundering around them and fighters ransacking houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Youssef, the ICRC official, said the agency has been in contact with the top command of both sides to ensure that medical assistance could reach hospitals safely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With this news today, we are really hoping that this becomes part of a steady coordination mechanism to allow other flights to come in,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Youssef said more medical aid was ready to be flown into Khartoum pending necessary clearances and security guarantees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudan’s healthcare system is near collapse with dozens of hospitals out of service. Multiple aid agencies have had to suspend operations and evacuated employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, a U.S. warship also arrived to Port Sudan to evacuate more American citizens, according to footage from the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the estimated 16,000 Americans believed to be in Sudan right now are dual U.S.-Sudanese nationals. The Defense Department said in a statement on Saturday it was moving naval assets toward Sudan’s coast to support further evacuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Britain has announced that an extra evacuation flight will depart from Port Sudan on Monday, extending what it called the largest evacuation effort of any Western country from Sudan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government asked British nationals who wish to leave Sudan to travel to the British Evacuation Handling Centre at Port Sudan International Airport before 12:00 Sudan time. The flight comes after an evacuation operation from Wadi Saeedna near Khartoum, involving 2,122 people on 23 flights.\n"

      "\n",
      "Ontario Power Generation paid more than $131,000 in severance to an executive who was fired because of an intervention on his first day by Premier Doug Ford’s then-chief of staff, according to a document revealed after a four-year freedom-of-information battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Crown corporation made the termination payment after Dean French, who was the Premier’s top aide at the time, expressed displeasure about OPG’s hiring of Alykhan Velshi as vice-president of stakeholder relations in September, 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Globe and Mail filed a freedom-of-information request for the severance allowance paid to Mr. Velshi, who was previously chief of staff to former Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown. OPG refused to disclose the amount, and The Globe appealed to Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent decision, IPC adjudicator Jessica Kowalski ordered OPG to disclose Mr. Velshi’s severance amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Kowalski rejected arguments from OPG’s lawyers that Mr. Velshi’s severance did not have to be disclosed because of a provision in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act excluding employment matters. She also did not accept the utility’s position that the termination payment should be exempt from disclosure because it could prejudice OPG’s economic interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the IPC order, OPG provided a document revealing Mr. Velshi’s severance was $131,676.01.\n",
      "\n",
      "OPG spokesman Neal Kelly did not respond to questions from The Globe about the adjudicator’s decision or whether the utility had paid Mr. Velshi for other claims relating to his firing, such as legal fees or general damages. The company also did not answer a question about why it had fired Mr. Velshi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Mr. Kelly provided a one-line statement, saying: “We don’t discuss individual staffing matters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Velshi’s salary at OPG was not made public, but a lawyer for the utility said the pay range for his role was $150,000 to $250,000 a year. Mr. Velshi’s predecessor was paid $223,140 in 2017, according to provincial records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Velshi declined comment for this article. Mr. Velshi, who also worked in former prime minister Stephen Harper’s office, was vice-president of corporate and public affairs for the Americas at Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei until January, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "OPG fired Mr. Velshi a few days after Mr. French personally contacted Bernard Lord, who was chairman of its board at the time, to express displeasure about Mr. Velshi’s hiring on his first day in September, 2018. However, Mr. Velshi stayed on until his termination took effect at the end of November of that year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not known what motivated Mr. French to ask OPG to fire Mr. Velshi. Mr. French did not respond to questions sent by e-mail last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a Globe report about Mr. Velshi’s firing in November, 2018, Mr. Ford maintained that OPG was responsible for its own hiring and said he didn’t believe that Mr. French had intervened. But the Premier also said he didn’t ask his top aide about the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokeswoman for Mr. Ford did not return e-mails seeking comment last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. French intervened in OPG’s staffing a few months after Mr. Velshi resigned as chief of staff to Mr. Brown in January, 2018, hours before the PC leader was forced to step down because of a CTV report alleging he had engaged in sexual misconduct. Mr. Brown denied the allegations and launched a lawsuit, which was settled last year after CTV said key details in its report were factually inaccurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Mr. Brown stepped down, Mr. Velshi became chief of staff to interim PC leader Vic Fedeli until Mr. Ford was elected party leader.\n"

      "\n",
      "The Calgary Flames started the 2022-23 season making a long-term commitment to head coach Darryl Sutter, and ended it looking for a different voice behind the bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Flames fired Sutter on Monday in the latest major change at the NHL club after a disappointing season. Sutter’s dismissal comes 11 months after being named the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the NHL’s top head coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I interviewed 25 players, coaches, coaching staff, training staff, spoke to prominent agents who represent key players on our team, and it became clear to me that we need a new voice to guide us forward,” Flames president of hockey operations and interim general manager Don Maloney said.\n",
      "\n",
      "One year after winning the Pacific Division and advancing to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Flames fell to fifth in the division and missed the post-season with a 38-27-17 record.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The players were very, very frustrated with the season,” Maloney said at a Monday news conference. “They truly believe we had a team good enough to be in the playoffs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sutter’s departure comes two weeks after former Flames general manager Brad Treliving turned down a contract extension and parted ways with the team.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The players of today, they want a voice, they have a voice, and you have to listen to that voice,” Maloney said. “You don’t want to make it that the inmates are running the asylum, so to speak, but they had some real observations on, in their minds, how we should move forward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Known for his gruff, no-nonsense approach, Sutter took heat at various times through last season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allan Walsh, agent for Flames forward Jonathan Huberdeau, took to Twitter in mid-February to critique how the team was being run.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result,” Walsh tweeted. “Also, negativity sucks the joy right out of players.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After tying for second in league scoring in 2021-22 with 115 points as a member of the Florida Panthers, Huberdeau’s production plummeted by 60 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Darryl is a very sharp man, he’s got a good hockey mind,” said Maloney. “He’s a firm coach, a hard coach, a demanding coach, and there’s a shelf life to that type of type of coaching. Obviously it felt his time had expired with us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Huberdeau, along with defenceman MacKenzie Weegar, came to the Flames in a blockbuster trade last summer for Matthew Tkachuk after the star forward said he wouldn’t sign long term in Calgary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after being acquired, Huberdeau signed a eight-year extension for US$115 million that kicks in next season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We underachieved and generally, underachieving doesn’t make for happy days,” said Maloney. “We’re optimistic when we hire the next manager and coach, we will have a new attitude in the sense of it’s a new beginning for a lot of players, including some of our players who had difficult seasons this year. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also reports of unhappiness from Nazem Kadri, who signed a seven-year, $49 million contract as a free agent after winning the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maloney says the team needs to do a better job of integrating youth because that’s how the league has evolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The younger players now, at 18, not only do they think they should be the NHL, but a lot of them can play in the NHL at a younger age,” said Maloney. “They’ve been groomed, they’ve been trained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody has their personal trainers, and nutritionists, and masseuse. They don’t come into this league any more wide-eyed and say oh my gosh, I’m over my head. They expect to get here and play.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Flames forward Jakob Pelletier, who turned 22 in March, was scratched most of the final month and 23-year-old Adam Ruzicka rarely played over the final three months. Sutter instead stuck with veterans like Milan Lucic, 34, and Trevor Lewis, 36.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a different world in that respect and I do think we have an older, experienced team here now, we could use a little more youth and energy into our lineup,” Maloney said. “You look around the league, you have to have young players on entry level contracts that are not just putting in six or seven minutes, that can play meaningful minutes to have any kind of success.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sutter’s departure continues the revolving door at coach. Since Bob Hartley was fired at the end of 2015-16, Calgary has gone through four head coaches – Glen Gulutzan, Bill Peters, Geoff Ward, and now Sutter, who signed a multiyear contract extension with Calgary in October that was set to begin next season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a lot of factors that go into a decision like this. But now it’s full-steam with searching for a manager and that manager and I will look and find the right head coach for this club,” said Maloney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monday’s move ends Sutter’s second tenure with the Flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sutter replaced Greg Gilbert behind Calgary’s bench on Dec. 28, 2002, and added GM duties after the end of the 2002-03 season.\n",
      "\n",
      "He led Calgary to its last Stanley Cup final appearance in the 2003-04, then stepped down as head coach to focus on his duties as GM after the 2005-06 campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sutter resigned as Flames GM on Dec. 28, 2010. He later won two Stanley Cup titles as head coach of the Los Angeles Kings in 2011-12 and 2013-14.\n"

      "“We may have some precipitation, some rain for the next 24 to 48 hours, so we’re still looking at and monitoring the level of the river,” Mr. Bonnardel said about the swollen Rivière du Gouffre, which tore apart roads in the region and left homes isolated. The floodwaters from the Rivière du Gouffre sliced in half Highway 138, the main road in the region, leaving residents stranded on either side.\n",
      "\n",

      "“The mood went from one of amazement, watching Mother Nature with the rushing river, and then you saw the rubble coming, the trees, the telephone poles, refrigerators, pieces of houses,” Mr. Prokofiev said.\n",
      "\n",

      "['Marieke Walsh'] 2023-05-01 22:14:03-04:00 Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino announces the government's plans to restrict automatic weapons, on May 1 in Ottawa.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government’s newly proposed ban on assault-style weapons won’t have any impact on guns that are currently legal in Canada, prompting accusations that the Liberals have broken another election promise and betrayed the country’s most prominent gun-control group.\n",
      "\n",
      "The revised plans from the minority government, released Monday, have the support of both the NDP and Bloc Québécois.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, the government ditched its first attempt to ban assault-style weapons after widespread criticism that it was overly broad and targeted hunters. Its new proposal will only apply to guns that are designed and manufactured after the new law takes effect. Additionally, the government is dropping the planned prohibition of 482 more firearms that Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino last year said are weapons that “have no place in our communities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That means the Simonov SKS will remain legal in Canada. The gun is popular for hunting but has also become notorious in crimes, including the killing of two Ontario police officers in October. The SKS became a key focus for critics of last year’s failed attempt to ban assault-style weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tracey Wilson with the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights called the new amendments a “retreat of sorts.” The group still decried the government’s policy, saying it is about winning votes rather than securing public safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late on Monday, Mr. Mendicino described the government’s newly proposed law as “an historic step” but also one that “acknowledges the realities of our current situation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the best path forward in this Parliament so we can advance Bill C-21 and deliver the most significant legislation on gun control and reducing gun violence in a generation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The whittled-down ban will be added as an amendment to Bill C-21, which was first introduced in May, 2022, with an initial focus on handguns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the amendments that will be presented to the House of Commons public safety committee on Tuesday are a new technical definition of what will constitute an assault-style weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new definition is different in two key ways from the one proposed last year and revoked in February. The definition will now only apply to future weapons, and it was narrowed to only apply to semi-automatic firearms that discharge centre-fire ammunition and are originally designed with a detachable magazine with a capacity of six rounds or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amendments will also tackle ghost guns, which are homemade or 3D printed and untraceable. The government said the proposed changes to Bill C-21 will create new offences and classify ghost guns as prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time Mr. Mendicino said the government will use regulations to revive a firearms advisory committee that will make recommendations on the classification of guns now on the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government would make regulations through the Firearms Act to ensure that guns are classified correctly before entering the Canadian market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new suite of changes amount to a “nothing burger,” said A.J. Somerset, a hunter, former soldier and author of Arms: The Culture and Credo of the Gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the minister’s framing about the significance of the steps outlined Monday, Mr. Somerset said “it does actually remarkably little” because it doesn’t address the guns on the market today.\n",
      "\n",
      "The approach also means though that the government is not at risk of repeating the firestorm it created with its first attempt at a ban last year. Under those amendments, Mr. Somerset said the wording that the government used in the definition would have banned virtually every semi-automatic, centre-fire firearm with a detachable magazine. Because of that, vast swaths of gun owners were left concerned that the ban would mean the government would force them to relinquish their firearms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The impact of the initial amendment was huge,” he said. In contrast, Monday’s proposal is “so minor in its effect that it will be hard to get people as riled up about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The minority government could have passed the revised amendments through the House of Commons with just the support of the NDP or Bloc, but the Liberals negotiated with both parties to ensure they would support their second attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For now, it’s better than what we had,” Bloc MP Kristina Michaud told The Globe and Mail on Monday. She said she had expected that after four months of consultations, the government would have been able to say which guns that are currently in the market should also be banned, but instead that will now be left to the advisory committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "NDP public safety critic Peter Julian defended the government’s approach, stressing the need to make sure that assault-style firearms “don’t come into the market in the first place.” But he repeatedly dodged questions about why New Democrats don’t want to ban other firearms already in use in Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservatives meantime said there was no substantive change in the new amendments. The party has previously said Bill C-21 should be revoked in its entirety.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Canadian Doctors for Protection from Guns, an advocacy group, issued a statement Monday supporting the government’s announcement, saying it won’t end all violence “but it will make the violence less lethal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, groups that were born out of the 1989 Montreal École Polytechnique massacre and the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting decried the new plans as inadequate and watered down. Long-time gun-control advocate and PolySeSouvient co-ordinator Heidi Rathjen said her group was stunned by the “total capitulation of the Trudeau government before the NDP’s duplicitous stand on banning assault weapons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne-Marie Edward was one of the 14 women murdered at the École Polytechnique 33 years ago. In Ottawa on Monday, her mother Suzanne Laplante-Edward said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally promised her his government would implement the ban at a previous Dec. 6 memorial. “He said ‘Madame Edward, you have my word of honour. This is going to be the time when we do it.’ ”\n",

      "“Well now he’s backing out,” she said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Quebec provincial police say two bodies have been recovered in a region northeast of Quebec City devastated by flooding where two volunteer firefighters were swept away during a rescue mission on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police spotted the first body in the Rivière du Gouffre just before 10 a.m. on Wednesday from a helicopter, Sgt. Beatrice Dorsainville told reporters, adding that they would wait for a coroner to confirm the person’s identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the afternoon, Sgt. Dorsainville told reporters the second body was recovered about 500 metres from where the first body was found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police said formal identification of the two people found will be made by a coroner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple media have reported that the two missing firefighters were Christopher Lavoie, 23, and Regis Lavoie, 55, who were reportedly not related.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 90 millimetres of rain has fallen since Saturday on St-Urbain, about 100 km northeast of the capital city, Environment Canada said. More than 60 mm of rain has fallen on nearby Baie St-Paul, where officials declared a state of emergency earlier this week and where about 600 people had been forced from their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flooding was also reported in the Lanaudiere and Laurentians regions, and in western Quebec. The ministry of Public Security said a half-dozen communities across the province had declared states of emergency due to the heavy rains.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s devastating,” said Gaston Duchesne, 67, municipal councillor and deputy mayor of Baie St-Paul, in an interview. “When you have four feet of water in your basement, or even more, then you come home and then you have to take everything out and throw it in the trash. It’s quite worrying and disturbing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said even homeowners who would be compensated still “lost a lot of personal stuff.” With the clean-up work that needs to be done, “it’s major inconveniences that no one would have wanted to suffer,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Duchesne, who has lived in Baie St-Paul for the past 60 years, said he had not seen flooding this bad since at least the 1970s and he was worried about what climate change would bring to his community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, “the population is very resilient,” he said, adding that volunteers flocked to help. “For a region like ours, it is more than important, and people feel supported in the adversity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carla Martinez, manager of the La Muse Inn, in Baie St-Paul, agreed. “Everyone wanted to help,” she said. And La Muse contributed, too, hosting people who lost their homes in the floods, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Quebec Premier Francois Legault visited the area, where flooding has washed out roads and left homes isolated. He spoke about the missing firefighters, one of whom he said was a man in his 50s who took his own boat to help a couple whose home was surrounded by water. The other man, Legault said, was “a young boy of 23 years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty-three years,” Legault repeated after a short pause. “It’s an infinite sadness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Legault asked people not to rush to judgment about the cause of their deaths. Firefighters and first responders, he said, “do an essential but risky job. Obviously, we try to minimize these risks as much as possible, but we can say thank you for their courage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychological support and financial aid would be offered to residents of the area, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legault toured the damaged town and spoke to residents who told him they were given five minutes to evacuate. Some people asked the premier what aid would be offered, explaining that their insurance didn’t cover flood damage.\n",

      "\n",
      "As of Friday morning, Alberta officials reported 78 active wildfires burning in the province, with 19 of those listed as out of control and about 13,000 people evacuated from their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with forecasts calling for warm and windy weather in the next few days, officials are urging residents in affected areas to heed emergency alerts and be prepared to leave their homes on short notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a stark reminder of how unpredictable and powerful wildfires can be,” said Stephen Lacroix, managing director at the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, at a media briefing Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hot, dry conditions have resulted in an early start to the wildfire season and will pose challenges for crews trying to stop them from spreading in coming days, said Christie Tucker, information unit manager with Alberta Wildfire, at the briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far this year, 348 wildfires have burned more than 25,000 hectares in the province, Ms. Tucker said, which is ”significantly more wildfire activity” for this time of year than Alberta has seen in recent years. Most of the fires are believed to be human-caused, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "An evacuation order was issued Thursday night for Drayton Valley and the surrounding rural area, affecting more than 7,000 residents. Up to 20 homes were believed to have been destroyed in Little Red River Cree Nation, officials said.\n",
      "\n",

      "In response to a question about the cause of the Drayton Valley fire, Ms. Tucker said it was under investigation.\n",

      "Rural Municipalities of Alberta president Paul McLauchlin was watching the smoke billow from large fires near Drayton Valley and Brazeau County when he spoke with The Globe on Friday afternoon from his property in Ponoka County, about 130 kilometres southwest of Edmonton.\n",

      "“I’ve never seen anything like this, to be quite honest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To help combat the wildfires, 79 firefighters from Quebec and Ontario are scheduled to arrive in Alberta Friday, through an agreement with the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. They will be assigned to where they are needed most as soon as they are available, Ms. Tucker said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fires were also flaring in Saskatchewan, where the province’s public safety agency on Friday reported 13 active ones. Six of the fires were classified as “not contained,” meaning they were expected to grow in size.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current wildfire situation in Alberta reflects changing climate conditions, said Mike Flannigan, a wildfire expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta’s busiest fire period tends to happen in May, said Dr. Flannigan, director of the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta. A devastating 2016 fire in Fort McMurray took place during May, the same month a significant fire occurred in Slave Lake in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the time of year when winds, temperatures and other conditions, such as the dryness of the ground, combine to create conditions for extreme fire weather, he explains. Such conditions might occur on only a handful of days, but the fires that result tend to be the large ones that result in significant damage to communities or landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Research we have done shows that extreme fire weather is increasing, so it’s only going to get more challenging,” Dr. Flannigan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As temperatures get hotter, air gets drier and the atmosphere can suck more moisture out of vegetation, he explained. That means drier fuels – which means fires are easier to start and easier to spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, the number of human-caused fires is trending down, he added, but the number of lightning-caused fires is on the rise, contributing to an overall increase in the areas burned, Dr. Flannigan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. McLauchlin is also the reeve of Ponoka County, where four fires have already sprung up this season. He said some of the blazes in rural Alberta are old fires sparked up again by the weather.

      "['Nancy Macdonald'] 2023-05-05 07:00:00-04:00 Open this photo in gallery: Regina’s Grady Greenslade scored three goals in just 10 seconds on March 12.Handout\n",
      "\n",
      "The thousand-to-one shot went in. Pigs flew. The moon turned a shade of blue. In a U13 hockey game last month, Regina’s Grady Greenslade scored three goals in just 10 seconds of game time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In 35 years of watching hockey, I’ve never seen anything so exciting,” said Regina Falcons head coach, Scott Karpinka. “Not in minor hockey, not in watching the pros.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His Falcons weren’t up against a group of lightweights, Mr. Karpinka adds; they were playing neighbouring Balgonie; and the rival Prairie Storm sat much higher in the standings than the Falcons.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would surely be one for the record books – if these things were kept for U13 hockey. Grady more than halved the NHL record set by Billy Mosienko in 1952. The pint-sized Winnipegger scored three goals in 21 seconds as captain of the Chicago Blackhawks, still the fastest hattie in league history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grady credits his pregame porridge – taken with a spoonful of craisins, some sugar and a little milk: “I felt it gave me all the energy I needed to get up and down the ice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a period, the Falcons were locked at one with the Prairie Storm. “Sometimes, the second period is my best friend,” says the Grade 7 student at École St-Pius X, in Regina’s south end. Grady didn’t have a single scoring chance in the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first goal of the day came with 11:30 remaining in the second. Grady grabbed a rebound at the hash marks and ripped the puck at an opening he’d spotted. “The goalie was screened,” he insists. Either way, the Falcons were now up by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ref dropped the puck at centre, Grady’s right winger grabbed it, and the two went racing down the ice on a 2-on-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grady was fed a beautiful pass, and snapped the disc past the goalie for his second of the day; 11:24 now remained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Karpinka considered switching up the lines. But it was starting to feel like there was a little magic floating in the fog above the ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nope. I’m going to keep him out there,” Mr. Karpinka remembers thinking. He and his assistant gave each other a nod: “We were on the same page: Let’s keep ‘em out there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This time, when the puck dropped, Grady grabbed it, and went charging down the left wing. He found himself in line with the goalie and thought: “I better pass. I don’t want to seem like a puck hog.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Grady’s pass banked off the goalie. And right back into the net.\n",
      "\n",
      "With 11:20 remaining, the Falcons were up by three.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prairie Storm collapsed after that. The game ended 9 to 1. It was the Falcons’ biggest blowout of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grady, who later netted a fourth goal, says he felt terrible for the goalie, remembering his time in net in novice, and what it felt like to have a puck fly past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team headed to Boston Pizza to celebrate its big win, and Grady’s hat trick. Even at the restaurant, “the team kept hyping me up,” Grady recalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he insists that wasn’t the highlight of the season for him – not even close. It was the time the team spent together. He remembers one night, in particular, playing mini sticks in the hallway of a Brandon hotel, long past bedtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just loved helping my players improve. I loved pumping them up in the dressing room. I loved helping anyone who needed it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Grady’s teachers and coaches insist he’s a workhorse, not a thoroughbred: “Grady is never satisfied,” says Sheila Luff, who teaches his split, Grade 7/8 class at St. Pius. “He’s always asking how he can get better, especially at math. He’s trying to get 100 per cent all of the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve never had a young player be such a leader,” says Mr. Karpinka, choking up, describing how Grady once led the team through edgework when the coaches were late to practice one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was like having a third coach out there. It’s like he was born to be captain of a hockey team.”\n"

      "\n",
      "So far this year, 348 wildfires have burned more than 25,000 hectares in the province, Ms. Tucker said, which is ”significantly more wildfire activity” for this time of year than Alberta has seen in recent years. Most of the fires are believed to be human-caused, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "An evacuation order was issued Thursday night for Drayton Valley and the surrounding rural area, affecting more than 7,000 residents. Up to 20 homes were believed to have been destroyed in Little Red River Cree Nation, officials said.\n",

      "Rural Municipalities of Alberta president Paul McLauchlin was watching the smoke billow from large fires near Drayton Valley and Brazeau County when he spoke with The Globe on Friday afternoon from his property in Ponoka County, about 130 kilometres southwest of Edmonton.\n",

      "\n",
      "To help combat the wildfires, 79 firefighters from Quebec and Ontario are scheduled to arrive in Alberta Friday, through an agreement with the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. They will be assigned to where they are needed most as soon as they are available, Ms. Tucker said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fires were also flaring in Saskatchewan, where the province’s public safety agency on Friday reported 13 active ones. Six of the fires were classified as “not contained,” meaning they were expected to grow in size.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current wildfire situation in Alberta reflects changing climate conditions, said Mike Flannigan, a wildfire expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta’s busiest fire period tends to happen in May, said Dr. Flannigan, director of the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta. A devastating 2016 fire in Fort McMurray took place during May, the same month a significant fire occurred in Slave Lake in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the time of year when winds, temperatures and other conditions, such as the dryness of the ground, combine to create conditions for extreme fire weather, he explains. Such conditions might occur on only a handful of days, but the fires that result tend to be the large ones that result in significant damage to communities or landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Research we have done shows that extreme fire weather is increasing, so it’s only going to get more challenging,” Dr. Flannigan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As temperatures get hotter, air gets drier and the atmosphere can suck more moisture out of vegetation, he explained. That means drier fuels – which means fires are easier to start and easier to spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, the number of human-caused fires is trending down, he added, but the number of lightning-caused fires is on the rise, contributing to an overall increase in the areas burned, Dr. Flannigan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. McLauchlin is also the reeve of Ponoka County, where four fires have already sprung up this season. He said some of the blazes in rural Alberta are old fires sparked up again by the weather. He even dumped a load of water on his own fire pit this week to make sure there were no tiny lingering tinders that could cause a problem.\n",

      "In Canada, the number of human-caused fires is trending down, he added, but the number of lightning-caused fires is on the rise, contributing to an overall increase in the areas burned, Dr. Flannigan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. McLauchlin is also the reeve of Ponoka County, where four fires have already sprung up this season. He said some of the blazes in rural Alberta are old fires sparked up again by the weather. He even dumped a load of water on his own fire pit this week to make sure there were no tiny lingering tinders that could cause a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "But others have been started by humans, and Mr. McLauchlin pleaded with smokers to refrain from lighting up in their cars until there is some moisture in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Smokers that throw their butts out the window should probably spend time in jail or on a fire line,” he said.\n"

The legal mechanism grants the government extraordinary powers to dictate movement in the province, access emergency funds and mobilize additional supports to prevent the crisis from escalating.\n",

      "“It’s not a step that we took lightly, but it’s one that will allow the quickest and most effective response,” said Ms. Smith, who on Saturday evening hosted her second government news conference of the day during the continuing provincial election campaign.\n",

      "“Much of Alberta has been experiencing a hot, dry spring and with so much kindling, all it takes is a few sparks to ignite some truly frightening wildfires. These conditions have resulted in the unprecedented situation our province is facing today,” she told media earlier in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were 110 fires burning across Alberta on Saturday evening, with 32 listed as out of control. Evacuation orders have been made in 20 communities over the last few days, including in Drayton Valley, with a population of around 7,000, on Thursday and Edson, with about 8,000 people, on Friday evening.\n",

      "The latest on the wildfires burning in Alberta\n",

      "The office of Bill Blair, Federal Minister of Emergency Preparedness, said there has been no formal request for federal assistance from Alberta but Ottawa stands ready to provide support.\n",
      "\n",
      "One blaze, about 800 kilometres north of Edmonton, has destroyed a number of homes in Little Red River Cree Nation, in addition to the community’s police station and general store. There have been some cases where people have had to evacuate more than once as fires spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranchers in parts of Alberta have also been working to move livestock out of danger and are preparing equipment such as water tankers, which are normally used to spray chemicals and fertilizer in the spring, to protect fields and equipment from fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lacroix said it difficult to determine the extent of damage done by the wildfires as smoke is greatly reducing visibility for firefighters and pilots in the affected areas. He did not say whether any injuries have been reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is “very unusual” for this much fire activity this early in the season, according to Christie Tucker, information unit manager with Alberta Wildfire, at the news conference on Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Late April, early May are traditionally high-risk times for wildfire because the very dry snow has melted and evaporated and we haven’t quite got full bloom on trees and grasses which helps slow down fire,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 350,000 hectares have burned so far in the province, which is more than what has been seen over the last five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said, later on Saturday, that firefighters and air resources from Ontario and Quebec are aiding provincial efforts and that Alberta will be requesting additional support from agencies across Canada and in the United States over the next few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richilda Guevarra, an evacuee from Edson, said that looking up at the sky while fleeing on Friday evening reminded her of the Eye of Sauron scene in The Lord of the Rings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s orange and black. It’s like the end of the world,” she said from a hotel in the mountain town of Jasper on Saturday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Guevarra, having never experienced an emergency evacuation before, said stress and uncertainty overwhelmed her when the order to leave came down. Her partner told her to pack the necessities: important documents, her passport and three days’ worth of clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stayed back to help transport evacuees, so Ms. Guevarra initially drove to Hinton with their dog and her children, about an hour west of Edson. But, worried about the threat of wildfires reaching that area, she decided to go further southwest to Jasper. There’s no telling when they’ll be able to return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I really don’t know what’s going to happen right now,” she said. “We just moved in town in our house. Everything is new. What if – knock on wood – it will burn? That’s always on my mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Edson evacuee, Andrew Stefanchuk said his family had their bags packed and ready to go. When the evacuation alert arrived, Mr. Stefanchuk and his parents were out of their home in minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most of the town, I’d say, was on the same page,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His family had planned to stay in Hinton but kept driving after seeing how busy the area was. They continued about 340 kilometres east to his grandparents’ home in Red Deer, which took them about seven hours. He said you “can’t worry yourself sick” about a home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You get out of town, and you escape with your life. That is more important than whatever you left behind,” said Mr. Stefanchuk, who left with some clothes, important paperwork and valuables.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Edmonton, an evacuation centre has been set up to provide temporary lodging, food, clothing, health and animal care. More than 1,000 people have registered at the Expo Centre due to wildfire in Drayton Valley and Brazeau County.\n",
      "\n",
      "RCMP Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki, during a separate news conference on Saturday, said four people were arrested on Friday after breaking into a gas station in the emptied town of Drayton Valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unfortunately, some people choose to try and take advantage of others and their properties during emergency situations such as these,” he said. It is the only such incident the RCMP is aware of so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zablocki said the RCMP is assisting local authorities across the province with orderly evacuations and the protection of people and property. He said it was important for residents to follow instructions from emergency personnel, including evacuation orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anyone who chooses to ignore evacuation notices is putting not only themselves in danger, but also potentially putting others, including first responders, into harm’s way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kevin Kunetzki, deputy criminal operations officer for the Alberta RCMP, said approximately 550 officers were dedicated to assisting communities affected by the fires. Mr. Zablocki said those resources were deployed strategically and that out-of-province manpower could be called upon in the next few days if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The raging wildfires come in the middle of a general election, with voting day scheduled for May 29. Ms. Smith said her staff have been keeping opposition NDP Leader Rachel Notley up to date on the ever-evolving situation. Both leaders said Saturday that it is too soon to say whether it will delay an official vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We want to make sure that every Albertan can participate in this election so, if we’re still in this position further down the road, then we might have to have that conversation,” Ms. Notley said. “Our primary focus should be public safety, getting these fires under control and getting folks back into their communities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The NDP has suspended six campaigns in ridings with active evacuation orders and Ms. Smith said two United Conservatives candidates have stepped away from the campaign. Ms. Notley is calling for a range of supports to be delivered to evacuees, including financial assistance and mental health services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lacroix said, later on Saturday, that evacuees with special needs who are unable to stay at an evacuation centre can request emergency financial assistance to cover hotel accommodations.\n",
      "\n",

      "District board chair Leonard Hiebert said there has also been reports of others driving into the wildfire area, located about 1,300 kilometres northeast of Vancouver.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In a statement issued Saturday, the district said that strong winds were “expected to contribute to the continued growth” of both the Boundary Lake and Red Creek wildfires for the next 24 to 48 hours.\n",

      "On Sunday, the Boundary Lake wildfire near Goodlow, B.C., grew from 1,900 to 3,000 hectares, while the Red Creek blaze encompassed 1,550 hectares near Fort St. John, B.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fires, which were discovered Friday, have placed 164 properties in total – 103 for Boundary Lake, 61 for Red Creek – under mandatory evacuation order. Another 397 properties are on alert for evacuation on short-notice, district officials said.\n",

      "The regional district’s area that covers both Boundary Lake and Red Creek has declared a state of local emergency to allow it to respond quicker to the wildfires.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The regional district, Hiebert said, is working on creating permits to facilitate emergency personnel re-entry into the fire zone to check on the welfare of the animals – but only if the wildfire situation allows.\n",

      "“At this time, it is not safe to do so,” he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "So far this year, 348 wildfires have burned more than 25,000 hectares across the province. Christie Tucker, information unit manager with Alberta Wildfire, said most of the fires are believed to be human-caused. Mike Flannigan, a wildfire expert, adds that while the number of human-caused fires is trending down in Canada, lightning-caused fires are on the rise, contributing to an overall increase in the areas burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current wildfire situation in Alberta also reflects changing climate conditions. The province’s busiest fire period tends to happen in May, said Dr. Flannigan, director of the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta. A devastating 2016 fire in Fort McMurray took place during May, the same month a significant fire occurred in Slave Lake in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the time of year when winds, temperatures and other conditions, such as the dryness of the ground, combine to create conditions for extreme fire weather, Dr. Flannigan explains. Such conditions might occur on only a handful of days, but the fires that result tend to be the large ones that result in significant damage to communities or landscapes.\n",

      "\n",
      "So far this year, 348 wildfires have burned more than 25,000 hectares across the province. Christie Tucker, information unit manager with Alberta Wildfire, said most of the fires are believed to be human-caused. Mike Flannigan, a wildfire expert, adds that while the number of human-caused fires is trending down in Canada, lightning-caused fires are on the rise, contributing to an overall increase in the areas burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current wildfire situation in Alberta also reflects changing climate conditions. The province’s busiest fire period tends to happen in May, said Dr. Flannigan, director of the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta. A devastating 2016 fire in Fort McMurray took place during May, the same month a significant fire occurred in Slave Lake in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the time of year when winds, temperatures and other conditions, such as the dryness of the ground, combine to create conditions for extreme fire weather, Dr. Flannigan explains. Such conditions might occur on only a handful of days, but the fires that result tend to be the large ones that result in significant damage to communities or landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Research we have done shows that extreme fire weather is increasing, so it’s only going to get more challenging,” Dr. Flannigan said.\n",

      "Former members of an elite Alberta wildfire-fighting crew say government budget cuts have left the province battling its current blazes short-handed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We could have been difference-makers,” said Jordan Erlandson, a former member of Alberta’s Rapattack team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those firefighters were trained to rappel from helicopters to get at wildfires while they still only covered a few hectares. When one storm sparked several fires, they could extinguish them before they merged. They also cleared landing spaces for other helicopters to bring in crews and gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "That program once had 63 firefighters stationed around the province, including at Edson, Fox Creek and Lac La Biche – communities now threatened by one of the busiest early fire seasons in provincial history.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that program was cut in 2019 by the United Conservatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They told us the program had been eliminated,” said former member Adam Clyne. “They just said budget.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The saving was $1.4-million. The province’s wildfire budget for 2019 was about $117-million.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, Devin Dreeshen, then minister of agriculture and forestry, said those firefighters spend only two per cent of the time rappelling from helicopters, and spend the rest of the time fighting wildfires on the ground. That figure is based on the number of times rappelling skills were used in the average of more than 1,400 fires in Alberta from 2014 to 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dreeshen said at that time those figures suggest the rapattackers’ skills are better used from the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, documents obtained under Freedom of Information legislation and supplied to The Canadian Press suggest Dreeshen underplayed the importance of an aerial attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those documents, from internal government communications, suggest that rappel crews were called out about 100 times annually between 2014 and 2018. They were forced to actually rappel into a fire about 23 times a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is an assessment of wildfires that rappel crews were deployed to that there were no other feasible means of getting to,” said one e-mail from a government forester.\n",
      "\n",
      "Light showers offered brief respite to scorching wildfires in Alberta, but officials said they are not 'out of the woods' yet as the province expects a 'warm up' toward the weekend. Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Government spokeswoman Leanne Niblock said Alberta has other ways to get at remote fires, including exiting a hovering helicopter and walking in from the nearest road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We continue to do all we can to fight these fires, and keep Albertans and their property and homes safe,” she said in an e-mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta had initially planned to replace the Rapattack crews by dangling firefighters beneath flying helicopters and depositing them at the fire site. Transport Canada blocked that plan, saying it was too dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Alberta documents acknowledge that beating through the bush to get to hot spots and clear landing pads would cost time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These activities can be performed by other trained crews by landing or driving to a nearby spot and driving in,” says a note from a government forester. “Clearly this will take additional time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Erlandson pointed out rappel crews sometimes jump many times into the same fire as part of a large campaign. He estimates teams jumped up 20 times per fire and probably closer to 100 times on the fire that levelled parts of Fort McMurray in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well, rappelling in remains one of the fastest and safest ways to get into thick bush, muskeg and dense forest. It also allows firefighters to get right to work instead of slogging overland with heavy equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That way, we don’t have firefighters that are bagged by the time they reach the fire line,” said Clyne.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it wasn’t all about the jumping.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rappel was just a tool,” Erlandson wrote in an e-mail. “Other tools included bigger pumps, bigger helicopters, bigger buckets on the helicopter, bigger crews, more hose, more saws, and more experience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Alberta is struggling with a fire season that had about 100 active fires on Monday. About 29,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes in several communities, although an evacuation order was lifted late Sunday for Edson, a town of about 8,400 people west of Edmonton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We would have caught some of them when they were small,” said Erlandson.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rapattackers could have helped, said Ryan Kalmanovitch, a contract firefighter currently battling blazes near Edson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’re definitely missed,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalmanovitch said Monday that even on relatively quiet days, rapattackers could be helping set fire perimeters and dousing hot spots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They would be able to action those while they’re small and that would allow us not to divert resources,” he said. “They would absolutely be useful, maybe more so than other crews.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta is expected to experience bigger and more intense wildfires as climate change lengthens the fire season and dries out fuels in the forest. Sooner or later, Alberta was going to experience a spring like it’s now having.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is going to cost taxpayers in the long run,” said Clyne. “This spring is a prime example.”\n"

      "\n",
      "An Indigenous-led report into a massive wildfire nearly six years ago that destroyed more than 100 homes and scorched a vast swath of British Columbia’s Interior says the blaze resulted in up to $1 billion per year in ongoing nature and ecosystem losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elephant Hill wildfire burned more than 1,900 square kilometres of forests, grasslands and properties in the summer of 2017, directly affecting numerous First Nations and other communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report was released Wednesday by the Secwepemcul’ecw Restoration and Stewardship Society, based in Kamloops, B.C. The society was founded by eight Secwepemc communities directly affected by the Elephant Hill wildfire and has been working to pursue landscape recovery and restoration throughout their territories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Susan Todd, president of consulting firm Solstice Sustainability Works Inc., led a research team that worked with the society to prepare the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Todd, who’s a chartered professional accountant and has a master’s degree in environmental management, said people may be uncomfortable attaching a monetary value to the environment and resources, but if “we don’t count them, they are effectively valued at zero.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We just need to make sure that we don’t take nature services for granted. When something seems free, then you tend to overuse it or you tend to use it badly,” she said in an interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "The economic analysis shows how resources, including wild food, timber, regulation of clean water supply and clean air, as well culture and well-being services, were affected by the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research estimated a range that varied widely for some resources. For instance, itdetermined the lost value in regulating water and stabilizing soils to mitigate floods and landslides was between $58 million and $101 million per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the lost value of culture, well-being and education services ranged from about $2.6 million to $26.7 million per year, depending on the frequency of such activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The costliest single item, water purification, was assigned a value of $433.5 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $1-billion annual price tag was calculated using the high estimated values, while the low estimate was about $512 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I like to be conservative. I never want to overstate the case and so that’s why it was important to me that we put in a range,” Todd said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She reiterated that the numbers are estimates, but researchers “used well-established ecological economics approaches to valuing ecosystem services.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis also estimated separate one-time losses, dominated by carbon storage loss from the burning of trees and soil valued at $1.57 billion to $1.58 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lost carbon absorption of the burned ecosystem was assigned an annual value of $15.2 million to $366.1 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report says assigning dollar values have limitations, but should still be used as a “tool for ensuring that nature’s services do not get undervalued in decision-making.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Todd also noted the data was collected in 2021 and does not account for inflation since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report highlights the need for greater investment in Indigenous-led restoration of fire affected areas, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2021, the society released another report that produced 30 calls to action to improve wildfire management and recovery practices. That report said the fire could have been better managed if the province, including the wildfire service, had worked with Indigenous communities earlier and more actively throughout the response and recovery processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Angie Kane, CEO of the society, said she hopes governments will also take the new report into account when conducting forest planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It highlights a concern around how important our ecosystem is and how important it is to start doing things to preserve and protect it,” she said in an interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our ecosystem is in a state of emergency. We just need to look at how we manage our forests, and how we move forward to mitigate the impacts of these wildfires and of climate change.”\n"

      "Bruce Linton was the founder and co-CEO of Canopy Growth, the first publicly traded cannabis company in North America. When weed first became legal in Canada, Bruce was riding the high. Under his leadership, Canopy grew into a company valued at around $18-billion. Bruce, in many ways, became the face of the cannabis boom. But things ended badly between Bruce and the company he created. Cannabis sales failed to meet the hype and in 2019, he was fired by the board. So what led to one of the most public business failures in recent memory? Bruce talks about how he got fired, why the cannabis sector hasn’t delivered on its colossal promise and what’s next for him.\n"

      "In Ottawa, Blair acknowledged the “unprecedented wildfire situation currently taking place in Alberta” and said the federal government has agreed to a request for assistance from the province.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are already moving resources into those communities from the Canadian Armed Forces and other resources to provide the assistance that they requested,” he said.\n",

      "Military resources are to be provided for two weeks initially, with a one-week extension possible if it’s determined help is still needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Alberta government said in a news release that troops from the 3rd Batallion, Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry and 1 Combat Engineer Regiment are to establish bases of operations. Army reserve soldiers from across Alberta are also deploying this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "The troops are to go to the Grande Prairie, Fox Creek and Drayton Valley areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The capabilities the CAF can bring to support Alberta are firefighting support to aid in mop-up operations and basic firefighting duties,” the province.\n",

      "“Airlift resources for increased mobility and logistical responsibilities, such as evacuating isolated communities, will also be provided. Engineering support will be provided where required, incorporating heavy equipment resources.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Blair said there is one request from Alberta that the military is not prepared to fulfil.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They also asked, for example, that the Canadian Armed Forces would be deployed to provide security in evacuated communities and that’s a policing function,” Blair said.\n",

      "In Northern Alberta, Chief Conroy Sewepagaham of Little Red River Cree Nation, which has seen some of the worst damage, said 85 homes have been destroyed in the community that is made up of Fox Lake, John D’Or Prairie, and Garden River. More than 3,700 residents have been evacuated.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said better infrastructure could have saved some of the homes from being destroyed and is asking the provincial and federal governments to work together to support improvements on the nation, including paving a local highway and installing fire hydrants. But he said the priority right now is to save lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve heard a lot of people saying, ‘Homes we can rebuild, lives we can’t,’ ” said Mr. Sewepagaham.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evacuation order for Edson, a town of about 8,000 people, and parts of Yellowhead County, with 6,000 or so rural residents, was lifted on Monday morning with officials asking residents not to all rush back at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mayor Kevin Zahara said the nearby blaze, about 14 kilometres outside of town, did not damage any structures inside Edson, but some in the eastern part of the county were affected. The area school and hospital remained closed on Monday but the town’s utilities were fully functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said support is needed from other levels of government to help residents who were temporarily displaced. “This has been a huge expense to them,” he said. “Some of them don’t have insurance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The municipality can’t afford to cover the costs associated with responding to the emergency either, said the mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other parts of the province, some ranchers and farmers have defied evacuation orders. Some are using heavy equipment to build firebreaks around their properties while others simply won’t desert their animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jens Jorgensen is among those staying behind on his 400-hectare farm with nearly 200 livestock, south of the hamlet of Wildwood. It’s calving season and he said he needs to be there when his animals give birth.\n",

      "“We have cattle, we have horses, we have poultry,” said Mr. Jorgensen. “How do you manage or take care of your animals, or who you rely on to do that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With rain on Sunday and overnight, he said there is no reason to leave but he is concerned about having enough power to keep his animals alive. He’s using generators to keep things running.\n",

      "['Matthew Mcclearn'] 2023-05-12 16:40:14-04:00 Canadian cities enjoy some of the cleanest air on Earth – and in recent decades it’s been getting cleaner. Yet the western provinces buck that trend: Communities in British Columbia and Alberta have recorded some of the worst air pollution levels in the country in recent years, a report from Environment and Climate Change Canada shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The culprit is no mystery: It’s wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burning forests and grasslands release plumes of dense smoke. How far they travel depends on wind and weather patterns and fire intensity, but they routinely degrade air quality thousands of kilometres away. In extreme cases, Canadian air quality has been significantly impaired by fires as distant as the western United States and even Siberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wildfire smoke is the air quality issue in Canada, now and for the future,” said Michael Brauer, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the health effects of air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Forest fire smoke covers Edmonton in 2019.SOCIAL MEDIA/Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfire smoke is a noxious cocktail of gases, water vapour and particles that contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and, most importantly, fine particulate matter – tiny liquid or solid bits with diameters of less than 2.5 micrometres (µm), called PM2.5 for short.\n",
      "\n",
      "PM2.5 concentrations are considered a good stand-in for overall air quality, and are used as a proxy for all wildfire smoke contaminants. The national standard for PM2.5 is 8.8 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³); in 2021 the World Health Organization halved its guideline for PM2.5, to 5 µg/m³.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 200 stations across the country track PM2.5 concentrations, which are expressed as annual averages (capturing chronic or prolonged exposure) as well as peak concentrations (representing acute exposures). A report published in January by Environment and Climate Change Canada observed no national trend in average concentrations, nor peak concentrations, since 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regionally, though, there are clear patterns: Southern Ontario, southern Quebec and Atlantic Canada have enjoyed decreasing peak concentrations. The opposite is happening in B.C. and the Prairies, where many cities now have elevated average PM2.5 levels, often above guidelines. (A recent report by the American Lung Association observed similar patterns in the western U.S., and identified wildfires as a “major contributing factor.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dennis Herod, a physical scientist and manager of smog analysis with the federal environment department, said wildfires can send PM2.5 levels through the roof, skewing annual averages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years ago, fires in the Northwest Territories registered thousands of micrograms per cubic metre, he said. “In 2017, in the interior of British Columbia, levels were up in the hundreds and even the thousands as well.”\n",

      "Canada’s air quality: Worsening in the West, but still among the best on Earth Elevated levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) measured in Western Canada are largely attributed to wildfires. One can see the impact in 2019 data from the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE), which has built a database linking environmental factors to health outcomes.

      "A wildfire can blanket distant cities and towns in smoke that smells not unlike a wood fireplace. The fine particles within can penetrate deep into a person’s lungs and bloodstream. Chronic exposure is known to promote certain diseases and shorten life. The effects of wildfire smoke are worse for children, seniors, people working or exercising outdoors, and people with certain chronic health issues, including lung or heart conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do the relatively mild differences in average PM2.5 readings between Canadian cities matter? Prof. Brauer said they do. Epidemiological research has shown that modest increases even from the lowest PM2.5 levels lead to increased mortality and other health consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When levels go up today compared to yesterday, we just see more people dying,” he said. “We’ve known this for air pollution and PM2.5 for decades now, but we now also have really strong evidence for wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And we also see that filtering down into other measures of health: more emergency room visits, more hospitalizations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada’s wildfire outlook is not encouraging, largely owing to climate change: Warm temperatures dry out landscapes, making them more prone to burn. According to the World Resources Institute, which tracks wildfires, boreal forests in high-latitude regions are losing more tree cover, likely because these areas are warming more quickly than other parts of the planet. That’s resulting in more numerous and severe fires, and it’s also extending fire seasons.\n",

      "A 2016 study of 561 wildfire-prone counties in the western U.S. estimated that, as climate change progresses, by mid-century the average wildfire-specific PM2.5 levels in those areas will increase 160 per cent from levels in the early 2000s. The researchers coined the term ”smoke waves” to describe more than two consecutive days with high levels of PM2.5 caused by wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the climate projections suggest this is going to get worse. Not forever, but we’re looking at a 50-year time frame, if not longer,” Prof. Brauer said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while there may be little Canadians can do to reduce wildfire risk in the immediate future, experts say that air quality should not be anyone’s leading health concern. Physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption all have much greater consequences. And the healthier you are, the less impact wildfire smoke is likely to have.\n",

      "“For the vast majority of people, these events will be reasonably well tolerated,” said Chris Carlsten, a professor at UBC with expertise in respiratory medicine and air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many options exist for mitigating the effects of wildfire smoke on health. Environment Canada and Health Canada jointly publish the Air Quality Health Index, which provides simple, up-to-date air quality indicators, along with guidance on when to reduce or avoid outdoor activities. If you must go outdoors into smoke-affected air, the American Lung Association recommends wearing a well-fitting N95 mask. Indoors, some HVAC systems have recirculation settings that can help keep smoke out of homes, and HEPA filters can further improve air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s about knowing your personal health and your experience with past fire events, and to have a plan that builds on that experience when the next one comes,” Prof. Carlsten said.\n"

      "['Matthew Mcclearn'] 2023-05-12 16:40:14-04:00 Canadian cities enjoy some of the cleanest air on Earth – and in recent decades it’s been getting cleaner. Yet the western provinces buck that trend: Communities in British Columbia and Alberta have recorded some of the worst air pollution levels in the country in recent years, a report from Environment and Climate Change Canada shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The culprit is no mystery: It’s wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burning forests and grasslands release plumes of dense smoke. How far they travel depends on wind and weather patterns and fire intensity, but they routinely degrade air quality thousands of kilometres away. In extreme cases, Canadian air quality has been significantly impaired by fires as distant as the western United States and even Siberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wildfire smoke is the air quality issue in Canada, now and for the future,” said Michael Brauer, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the health effects of air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Forest fire smoke covers Edmonton in 2019.SOCIAL MEDIA/Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfire smoke is a noxious cocktail of gases, water vapour and particles that contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and, most importantly, fine particulate matter – tiny liquid or solid bits with diameters of less than 2.5 micrometres (µm), called PM2.5 for short.\n",
      "\n",
      "PM2.5 concentrations are considered a good stand-in for overall air quality, and are used as a proxy for all wildfire smoke contaminants. The national standard for PM2.5 is 8.8 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³); in 2021 the World Health Organization halved its guideline for PM2.5, to 5 µg/m³.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 200 stations across the country track PM2.5 concentrations, which are expressed as annual averages (capturing chronic or prolonged exposure) as well as peak concentrations (representing acute exposures). A report published in January by Environment and Climate Change Canada observed no national trend in average concentrations, nor peak concentrations, since 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regionally, though, there are clear patterns: Southern Ontario, southern Quebec and Atlantic Canada have enjoyed decreasing peak concentrations. The opposite is happening in B.C. and the Prairies, where many cities now have elevated average PM2.5 levels, often above guidelines. (A recent report by the American Lung Association observed similar patterns in the western U.S., and identified wildfires as a “major contributing factor.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dennis Herod, a physical scientist and manager of smog analysis with the federal environment department, said wildfires can send PM2.5 levels through the roof, skewing annual averages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years ago, fires in the Northwest Territories registered thousands of micrograms per cubic metre, he said. “In 2017, in the interior of British Columbia, levels were up in the hundreds and even the thousands as well.”\n",

      "A wildfire can blanket distant cities and towns in smoke that smells not unlike a wood fireplace. The fine particles within can penetrate deep into a person’s lungs and bloodstream. Chronic exposure is known to promote certain diseases and shorten life. The effects of wildfire smoke are worse for children, seniors, people working or exercising outdoors, and people with certain chronic health issues, including lung or heart conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do the relatively mild differences in average PM2.5 readings between Canadian cities matter? Prof. Brauer said they do. Epidemiological research has shown that modest increases even from the lowest PM2.5 levels lead to increased mortality and other health consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When levels go up today compared to yesterday, we just see more people dying,” he said. “We’ve known this for air pollution and PM2.5 for decades now, but we now also have really strong evidence for wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And we also see that filtering down into other measures of health: more emergency room visits, more hospitalizations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada’s wildfire outlook is not encouraging, largely owing to climate change: Warm temperatures dry out landscapes, making them more prone to burn. According to the World Resources Institute, which tracks wildfires, boreal forests in high-latitude regions are losing more tree cover, likely because these areas are warming more quickly than other parts of the planet. That’s resulting in more numerous and severe fires, and it’s also extending fire seasons.\n",

      "A 2016 study of 561 wildfire-prone counties in the western U.S. estimated that, as climate change progresses, by mid-century the average wildfire-specific PM2.5 levels in those areas will increase 160 per cent from levels in the early 2000s. The researchers coined the term ”smoke waves” to describe more than two consecutive days with high levels of PM2.5 caused by wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the climate projections suggest this is going to get worse. Not forever, but we’re looking at a 50-year time frame, if not longer,” Prof. Brauer said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while there may be little Canadians can do to reduce wildfire risk in the immediate future, experts say that air quality should not be anyone’s leading health concern. Physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption all have much greater consequences. And the healthier you are, the less impact wildfire smoke is likely to have.\n",

      "“For the vast majority of people, these events will be reasonably well tolerated,” said Chris Carlsten, a professor at UBC with expertise in respiratory medicine and air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many options exist for mitigating the effects of wildfire smoke on health. Environment Canada and Health Canada jointly publish the Air Quality Health Index, which provides simple, up-to-date air quality indicators, along with guidance on when to reduce or avoid outdoor activities. If you must go outdoors into smoke-affected air, the American Lung Association recommends wearing a well-fitting N95 mask. Indoors, some HVAC systems have recirculation settings that can help keep smoke out of homes, and HEPA filters can further improve air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s about knowing your personal health and your experience with past fire events, and to have a plan that builds on that experience when the next one comes,” Prof. Carlsten said.\n"

Under his leadership, Canopy grew into a company valued at around $18-billion. Bruce, in many ways, became the face of the cannabis boom. But things ended badly between Bruce and the company he created. Cannabis sales failed to meet the hype and in 2019, he was fired by the board.

      "Officials are warning more wildfires in Alberta are expected this weekend, as hot weather persists and thousands of residents remain under evacuation orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were 83 active fires Saturday in the province, including 21 deemed out of control, said Josée St-Onge, a spokesperson with Alberta Wildfire, during a news conference. That is up from 76 active wildfires on Friday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While we have seen cooler temperatures and some rain in previous days, it is not enough to make a significant difference on these large wildfires,” Ms. St-Onge said. “Fire activity will pick up today.”\n",

      "Bre Hutchinson of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency said approximately 16,520 people remained under evacuation orders throughout the province, and that the risk of new wildfires was high for the next few days.

      "\n",
      "Alberta is well-acquainted with natural disasters, but the early-season nature and ferocity of the wildfires in the northern part of the province this spring make them stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 20 out-of-control fires, spread out across a vast swath of boreal forest. Thousands of people have been forced out of their homes, and the Little Red River First Nation has lost about 85 structures. Firefighters from outside the province are streaming in, while the Canadian Armed Forces have been brought in for airlifts and engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though cooler weather this week helped, this hot, hot weekend will be a test. Temperatures will reach 30 C on Saturday and Sunday in Grande Prairie. Alberta Wildfire, the government agency, said crossover conditions – already seen earlier this month when some of the fires began – will be part of the mix. Crossover happens when the numerical value for the ambient humidity is lower than the temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a recipe for wildfire, and it could make a terrible situation in Alberta even worse. It also brings a series of dilemmas for the provincial election campaign, which has logically taken a backseat to the disaster at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only is the campaigning more subdued than it might have been, but it also leads to the unusual situation in which United Conservative Party Leader Danielle Smith has to actively do the job of premier. Usually, candidates step away from any policy during an election campaign, except, of course, when the province is facing an emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understandably, Ms. Smith looked flustered in Calgary on Thursday morning at a UCP event as she switched from premier mode – talking about the wildfire – to partisan attacks against the NDP. She should have left any and all discussion of the wildfire situation to the Government of Alberta afternoon briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in premier mode again on Friday, Ms. Smith toured the County of Grande Prairie by helicopter, accompanied by Todd Loewen, the Minister of Forestry, Parks and Tourism, and Marshall Smith, who served as chief of staff in the Premier’s office.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are still many political implications beyond images of Ms. Smith acting in premier fashion during an election. The UCP is also being lambasted for cutting its wildfire response capacity. In what seems an ultimate example of being penny-wise and pound-foolish, the province in 2019 cut the elite team of firefighters – the Rapattack team – trained to rappel from helicopters to get at wildfires early, while they only covered a few hectares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Documents obtained under Freedom of Information legislation and supplied to The Canadian Press found that the government said Alberta had initially planned to replace the Rapattack crews by dangling firefighters beneath flying helicopters and depositing them at the fire site. But Transport Canada blocked that plan, saying it was too dangerous. The documents also acknowledge that beating through the bush to get to hot spots and clear landing pads would cost time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whichever party forms government, the wildfires place local emphasis on what a changing climate means – whether that’s policy and spending on adaptation (and firefighting), or more detailed emissions policies from one of the world’s biggest oil-producing jurisdictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "These fires stand out because of how early they’ve come and how much land they’ve burned. But they’re just one event on a long list of terrifying wildfires in Western North America in recent years – including Fort McMurray in May, 2016. We know there will be more “unprecedented” fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the wildfires, of course, have ramifications for the election campaign itself. At least one municipal official, the mayor of Yellowhead County, has called for the election to be postponed. UCP and NDP candidates in fire-affected areas have paused their campaigning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at a stop in Calgary on Thursday evening, NDP Leader Rachel Notley said she is staying in close touch with people on the ground in fire-hit areas. But she didn’t have any plans to tour there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfires are impairing air quality across Western Canada, reversing decades of progress\n",
      "\n",
      "“Generally speaking, when people are in the midst of fighting wildfire, politicians are not really your best foot forward in getting the actual fire controlled,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the situation worsens, Elections Alberta might also be forced to take more drastic actions. Right now, the non-partisan agency is providing voting options – such as special ballots – to those forced out of their homes. The office is watching to make sure polling stations are still intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further actions by Elections Alberta could be even more dramatic in what’s expected to be an incredibly close election.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the Chief Electoral Officer concludes we no longer have the ability to provide voting services or access to voting, we will make an application to the Court of the King’s Bench to discontinue the election in an individual electoral division,” spokesperson Michelle Gurney said in an e-mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta has 87 ridings, and applications to discontinue voting need to be made for each – based on whether a disaster is affecting the ability of people to vote. Once that application is made by chief electoral officer Glen Resler, the decision would rest with the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s another political dimension for Albertans to contend with. Ms. Smith came to lead the UCP in large part by winning the votes of those who despised the pandemic rules of Jason Kenney and other cabinet ministers. She’s now in the premier’s chair herself at a time when the province again faces an emergency situation, in which people are suffering, the outcome is unknown and mistrust of the government is running high.\n",
      "\n",
      "A video in which local officials earlier this week answered questions for Grande Prairie residents forced to leave their homes and farms put some of these issues on display.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of the meeting, there were wholly understandable concerns expressed about the safety of property, pets and livestock left behind in a heart-wrenchingly quick evacuation. There was anger over a lack of firefighting resources and communication, and local bulldozers and manpower not being put into use. There was lots of thanks given for the work of firefighters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things got darker at points, too. People spoke about forcibly driving through evacuation lines to get to their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is like COVID all over again,” one man shouted. “We dealt with this for three years and we’re done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These are takes Ms. Smith might have explored or encouraged as a radio host or podcaster. Now she is Premier. How does she respond? How does she govern? We might find out as early as this weekend.\n"

      "The culprit is no mystery: It’s wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burning forests and grasslands release plumes of dense smoke. How far they travel depends on wind and weather patterns and fire intensity, but they routinely degrade air quality thousands of kilometres away. In extreme cases, Canadian air quality has been significantly impaired by fires as distant as the western United States and even Siberia.\n",

      "Wildfire smoke is a noxious cocktail of gases, water vapour and particles that contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and, most importantly, fine particulate matter – tiny liquid or solid bits with diameters of less than 2.5 micrometres (µm), called PM2.5 for short.\n",
      "\n",
      "PM2.5 concentrations are considered a good stand-in for overall air quality, and are used as a proxy for all wildfire smoke contaminants. The national standard for PM2.5 is 8.8 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³); in 2021 the World Health Organization halved its guideline for PM2.5, to 5 µg/m³.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 200 stations across the country track PM2.5 concentrations, which are expressed as annual averages (capturing chronic or prolonged exposure) as well as peak concentrations (representing acute exposures). A report published in January by Environment and Climate Change Canada observed no national trend in average concentrations, nor peak concentrations, since 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regionally, though, there are clear patterns: Southern Ontario, southern Quebec and Atlantic Canada have enjoyed decreasing peak concentrations. The opposite is happening in B.C. and the Prairies, where many cities now have elevated average PM2.5 levels, often above guidelines. (A recent report by the American Lung Association observed similar patterns in the western U.S., and identified wildfires as a “major contributing factor.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dennis Herod, a physical scientist and manager of smog analysis with the federal environment department, said wildfires can send PM2.5 levels through the roof, skewing annual averages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years ago, fires in the Northwest Territories registered thousands of micrograms per cubic metre, he said. “In 2017, in the interior of British Columbia, levels were up in the hundreds and even the thousands as well.”\n",

      "A wildfire can blanket distant cities and towns in smoke that smells not unlike a wood fireplace. The fine particles within can penetrate deep into a person’s lungs and bloodstream. Chronic exposure is known to promote certain diseases and shorten life. The effects of wildfire smoke are worse for children, seniors, people working or exercising outdoors, and people with certain chronic health issues, including lung or heart conditions.\n",

      "Do the relatively mild differences in average PM2.5 readings between Canadian cities matter? Prof. Brauer said they do. Epidemiological research has shown that modest increases even from the lowest PM2.5 levels lead to increased mortality and other health consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When levels go up today compared to yesterday, we just see more people dying,” he said. “We’ve known this for air pollution and PM2.5 for decades now, but we now also have really strong evidence for wildfires.\n",

      "“And we also see that filtering down into other measures of health: more emergency room visits, more hospitalizations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada’s wildfire outlook is not encouraging, largely owing to climate change: Warm temperatures dry out landscapes, making them more prone to burn. According to the World Resources Institute, which tracks wildfires, boreal forests in high-latitude regions are losing more tree cover, likely because these areas are warming more quickly than other parts of the planet. That’s resulting in more numerous and severe fires, and it’s also extending fire seasons.\n",

      "A 2016 study of 561 wildfire-prone counties in the western U.S. estimated that, as climate change progresses, by mid-century the average wildfire-specific PM2.5 levels in those areas will increase 160 per cent from levels in the early 2000s. The researchers coined the term ”smoke waves” to describe more than two consecutive days with high levels of PM2.5 caused by wildfires.\n",

      "But while there may be little Canadians can do to reduce wildfire risk in the immediate future, experts say that air quality should not be anyone’s leading health concern. Physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption all have much greater consequences. And the healthier you are, the less impact wildfire smoke is likely to have.\n",

      "Many options exist for mitigating the effects of wildfire smoke on health. Environment Canada and Health Canada jointly publish the Air Quality Health Index, which provides simple, up-to-date air quality indicators, along with guidance on when to reduce or avoid outdoor activities. If you must go outdoors into smoke-affected air, the American Lung Association recommends wearing a well-fitting N95 mask. Indoors, some HVAC systems have recirculation settings that can help keep smoke out of homes, and HEPA filters can further improve air quality.\n",

      "\n",
      "Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group in the Gaza Strip agreed to an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire late Saturday, seeking to halt five days of intense fighting that killed 33 Palestinians, including at least 13 civilians. Two people in Israel were killed by rocket fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tenuous cease-fire appeared to take effect just after 10 p.m., with a last-minute burst of rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes stretching several minutes past the deadline announced by Egypt. Late Saturday, Israel reported additional incoming fire and said it was again striking in Gaza. But the calm appeared to be quickly restored.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the calm appeared to bring a sense of relief to Gaza’s more than 2 million people and hundreds of thousands of Israelis who had been largely confined to bomb shelters in recent days, the agreement did nothing to address the underlying issues that have fueled numerous rounds of fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Gaza, Islamic Jihad spokesman Tareq Selmi said Israel had agreed to halt its policy of targeted strikes on the group’s leaders. “Any stupidity or assassination by the occupation will be met with a response and the Zionist enemy bears the responsibility,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in a statement thanking Egypt for its mediation efforts, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser, Tzachi Nanegbi, said that “quiet would be answered with quiet” and Israel would do “everything that it needs to in order to defend itself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tensions could quickly resume next week when Israel holds a contentious march through a main Palestinian thoroughfare in Jerusalem’s Old City.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, as the truce took hold, the deafening whooshes of outgoing rockets and booms of Israeli airstrikes were replaced by the honking of cars in Gaza. Streets that had been desolate in recent days quickly teemed with people reveling in the ceasefire, waving Palestinian flags and flashing victory signs from speeding vehicles. Amid the celebration, a fruit vendor used a loudspeaker, enthusiastically promoting his supply of bananas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest violence erupted Tuesday when Israeli airstrikes killed three senior Islamic Jihad commanders. Israel said the airstrikes were in response to a burst of rocket fire the previous week and that its attacks have been focused on Islamic Jihad targets. But residents in Gaza said homes of people uninvolved in fighting also had been struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least 10 civilians, including women, young children and uninvolved neighbors were killed in those initial strikes, which drew regional condemnation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past few days, Israel has conducted more airstrikes, killing other senior Islamic Jihad commanders and destroying their command centers and rocket-launching sites. But the airstrikes showed no signs of stopping the rocket fire, prompting Islamic Jihad to declare victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel reported over 1,200 launches throughout the fighting, with some rockets reaching as far as the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem areas. Israel said about a quarter of the rockets were misfired and landed in Gaza, while most of the rest were either intercepted or landed in open areas. But an 80-year-old woman and a Palestinian laborer who was working inside Israel were killed by rocket fire. A Palestinian human rights group said three people, including two children, were killed in Gaza by errant rockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the latest in a long series of battles between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza since the Islamic militant group Hamas seized control of the seaside territory in 2007. Israel and Hamas have fought four wars, and there have been numerous smaller flareups as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday’s deal did not address many of the many of the causes of the repeated fighting, including Israel’s ongoing blockade of Gaza, the large arsenals of weapons possessed by Hamas and Islamic Jihad and Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians claim all three areas for a future state. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but Hamas subsequently overran the territory and expelled forces loyal to the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israel and Egypt have maintained a blockade over Gaza in what Israel says is a policy aimed at preventing Hamas from arming. The Palestinians and international rights groups say the policy, which restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, amount to collective punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which governs semi-autonomous parts of the West Bank, said Gaza’s main cargo crossing with Israel would open Sunday. Hamas’ government warned on Saturday that if the crossing doesn’t open, the lone power plant in Gaza will stop, further deepening a power crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more powerful Hamas has praised Islamic Jihad’s strikes but remained on the sidelines during the latest round of fighting, limiting the scope of the conflict. As the de facto government held responsible for the abysmal conditions in the blockaded Gaza Strip, Hamas has recently tried to keep a lid on its conflict with Israel. Islamic Jihad, on the other hand, a more ideological and unruly militant group wedded to violence, has taken the lead in the past few rounds of fighting with Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a reminder of the combustible situation in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military raided the Balata refugee camp near the northern city of Nablus, sparking a firefight that killed two Palestinians. In a separate incident near the northern city of Jenin, Israeli police said they shot and killed a suspected Palestinian assailant who ran toward soldiers wielding a knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli-Palestinian fighting has surged in the West Bank under Israel’s most right-wing government in history. Since the start of the year, 111 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, at least half of them affiliated with militant groups, according to a tally by The Associated Press. In that time, 20 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truce could be further tested on Thursday when Israeli nationalists plan their annual “Jerusalem Day” march through the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City. The march, meant to celebrate Israel’s capture of the Old City and its Jewish holy sites in 1967, is a frequent source of friction and helped spark an 11-day war with Hamas in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, Palestinians in Gaza ventured out to assess the damage wrought by Israeli warplanes and salvage whatever they could from four destroyed homes in a densely populated neighborhood. Residents denied the army’s claims that it had attacked Islamic Jihad targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have no rocket launching pads at all. This is a residential area,” said Awni Obaid, beside the debris of what was his three-story house in the central town of Deir al-Balah.\n",

      "The nearby house of his relative, Jehad Obaid, was also leveled.\n",
      "\n",

      "['Matthew Mcclearn'] 2023-05-12 16:40:14-04:00 Canadian cities enjoy some of the cleanest air on Earth – and in recent decades it’s been getting cleaner. Yet the western provinces buck that trend: Communities in British Columbia and Alberta have recorded some of the worst air pollution levels in the country in recent years, a report from Environment and Climate Change Canada shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The culprit is no mystery: It’s wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burning forests and grasslands release plumes of dense smoke. How far they travel depends on wind and weather patterns and fire intensity, but they routinely degrade air quality thousands of kilometres away. In extreme cases, Canadian air quality has been significantly impaired by fires as distant as the western United States and even Siberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wildfire smoke is the air quality issue in Canada, now and for the future,” said Michael Brauer, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the health effects of air pollution.\n",

      "Open this photo in gallery: Forest fire smoke covers Edmonton in 2019.SOCIAL MEDIA/Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfire smoke is a noxious cocktail of gases, water vapour and particles that contains sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and, most importantly, fine particulate matter – tiny liquid or solid bits with diameters of less than 2.5 micrometres (µm), called PM2.5 for short.\n",
      "\n",
      "PM2.5 concentrations are considered a good stand-in for overall air quality, and are used as a proxy for all wildfire smoke contaminants. The national standard for PM2.5 is 8.8 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³); in 2021 the World Health Organization halved its guideline for PM2.5, to 5 µg/m³.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 200 stations across the country track PM2.5 concentrations, which are expressed as annual averages (capturing chronic or prolonged exposure) as well as peak concentrations (representing acute exposures). A report published in January by Environment and Climate Change Canada observed no national trend in average concentrations, nor peak concentrations, since 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regionally, though, there are clear patterns: Southern Ontario, southern Quebec and Atlantic Canada have enjoyed decreasing peak concentrations. The opposite is happening in B.C. and the Prairies, where many cities now have elevated average PM2.5 levels, often above guidelines. (A recent report by the American Lung Association observed similar patterns in the western U.S., and identified wildfires as a “major contributing factor.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dennis Herod, a physical scientist and manager of smog analysis with the federal environment department, said wildfires can send PM2.5 levels through the roof, skewing annual averages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years ago, fires in the Northwest Territories registered thousands of micrograms per cubic metre, he said. “In 2017, in the interior of British Columbia, levels were up in the hundreds and even the thousands as well.”\n",

      "A wildfire can blanket distant cities and towns in smoke that smells not unlike a wood fireplace. The fine particles within can penetrate deep into a person’s lungs and bloodstream.

      "“When levels go up today compared to yesterday, we just see more people dying,” he said. “We’ve known this for air pollution and PM2.5 for decades now, but we now also have really strong evidence for wildfires.\n",

      "Canada’s wildfire outlook is not encouraging, largely owing to climate change: Warm temperatures dry out landscapes, making them more prone to burn. According to the World Resources Institute, which tracks wildfires, boreal forests in high-latitude regions are losing more tree cover, likely because these areas are warming more quickly than other parts of the planet. That’s resulting in more numerous and severe fires, and it’s also extending fire seasons.\n",

The researchers coined the term ”smoke waves” to describe more than two consecutive days with high levels of PM2.5 caused by wildfires.\n",

      "But while there may be little Canadians can do to reduce wildfire risk in the immediate future, experts say that air quality should not be anyone’s leading health concern. Physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption all have much greater consequences. And the healthier you are, the less impact wildfire smoke is likely to have.\n",

      "Many options exist for mitigating the effects of wildfire smoke on health. Environment Canada and Health Canada jointly publish the Air Quality Health Index, which provides simple, up-to-date air quality indicators, along with guidance on when to reduce or avoid outdoor activities. If you must go outdoors into smoke-affected air, the American Lung Association recommends wearing a well-fitting N95 mask. Indoors, some HVAC systems have recirculation settings that can help keep smoke out of homes, and HEPA filters can further improve air quality.\n",

      "\n",
      "While many of the evacuation orders that have affected the northern half of the province over the past 10 days have been rescinded, frustrations with the wildfire response have persisted among some residents, who may be forced from their homes again if fires reignite or spread.\n",

      "['Doug Haller'] 2023-05-14 00:00:00 PHOENIX — Mat Ishbia took ownership of the Phoenix Suns in February, not even 100 days ago. His first major move was orchestrating a trade for Kevin Durant, a franchise-altering decision designed to position the Suns for their first NBA title.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, not quite 48 hours after Phoenix was embarrassingly eliminated from the Western Conference semifinals, Ishbia made a second major move. After talking with general manager James Jones about the organization’s direction, he fired coach Monty Williams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Ishbia made his fortune in the mortgage-lending business, doing so with a hands-on approach he calls “being in the weeds.” While it wasn’t initially clear how that would translate into NBA ownership, it is now. Ishbia has a heavy hand in basketball operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Thursday’s 125-100 elimination loss to the top-seeded Denver Nuggets, Williams had taken responsibility for not having the Suns ready to play. A day later at the Phoenix practice facility, he said he understood the business aspect of NBA coaching and the pitfalls that come with it. All he could control was doing the best job possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement announcing the dismissal, Jones credited Williams for his role in the organization’s reversal, which included a trip to the 2021 NBA Finals and posting the league’s best regular-season record a season later. “We are filled with gratitude for everything Monty has contributed to the Suns and to the Valley community,” Jones said. “While it was difficult for me to make this decision, I look forward to continuing the work to build a championship team.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Where Phoenix goes from here isn’t clear. Mike Budenholzer, an Arizona native recently fired from his job as head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, will be connected to the job. Former Toronto coach Nick Nurse, fired last month, may as well. Both coaches have won championships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Suns have sturdy pillars in Durant and Devin Booker, two of the best players in the sport. They also have questions. Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 pick of the 2018 NBA Draft, has yet to realize his potential and has possibly regressed. Chris Paul, who just turned 38, has slowed and is set to make $30.8 million next season, but only half is guaranteed. The roster is top-heavy, and the Suns don’t have much financial flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "GO DEEPER After another head-scratching elimination loss, Suns face difficult offseason questions\n",
      "\n",
      "A former walk-on point guard at Michigan State, Ishbia has a basketball background. Upon graduation, he turned down a job to become a college assistant coach and instead joined his father’s mortgage business. Ishbia says he strives to learn every aspect of his trade, and he has treated basketball the same. If he doesn’t know the answer, he surrounds himself with those who might. This was clear throughout the playoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Close friend Isiah Thomas, the Hall of Fame point guard and former NBA coach and executive, was by Ishbia’s side throughout the postseason, on the road and at home. Michigan State coach Tom Izzo and former college teammate Mateen Cleaves also visited. Every game, Ishbia sat in the front row, leaning forward, hands clasped, looking like the coach he almost became.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not known if Ishbia or Jones consulted with Booker or Durant before dismissing Williams, but it would be odd if they did not. As reporters on Friday were let into the practice facility, Booker walked up the stairs with Jones for his exit interview. Booker, almost always available to the media, didn’t talk to reporters after Game 6 and left the practice facility before doing so Friday. That may have meant something or nothing at all. Booker next season will have his sixth head coach in nine years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Durant had a history with Williams. Early in his career, during his time with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Williams was an assistant coach under Billy Donovan. It didn’t take long for him to earn Durant’s respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love him already,” Durant said not long after meeting Williams. “He’s just a great teacher of the game. Great with people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Williams went 194-115 over four seasons with Phoenix. For an organization that had bottomed out, missing the postseason for nine consecutive seasons, he changed the culture, and he did so with professionalism and grace. Driven and confident, Williams wasn’t afraid to admit what he didn’t know, and he took responsibility when the Suns didn’t play up to the standard he had set.\n",
      "\n",
      "After missing the playoffs his first season, Williams led the Suns on a surprising run to the 2021 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Bucks in six games. In 2022, Phoenix posted a franchise-record 64 wins before flaming out against Luka Dončić and the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference semifinals. Like this season, they were routed at home in the decisive game, a sour finish to an outstanding season. Williams was named the NBA’s Coach of the Year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, Ishbia bought the team from suspended governor Robert Sarver and pulled off the Durant trade in February. By the time Durant recovered from a knee injury, the Suns had 20 games to build chemistry before the playoffs. Expectations soared. The Suns won their first three before Durant sprained his left ankle on March 8 during pregame warmups, a setback that sidelined him for three weeks. In hindsight, it may have sealed Phoenix’s fate. Maybe Williams’ as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Obviously, if KD doesn’t get hurt in warmups, things may be different right now, we may still be playing,’’ reserve guard Damion Lee said Friday. “If we didn’t make the trade, things may be different. Who knows? We can’t live in the fantasy world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With Ishbia watching courtside, Williams made questionable decisions in the playoffs. After going 8-0 with Durant in the lineup during the regular season, he altered his starting five in Game 1 against the Clippers. He never settled on a rotation, subbing by feel, a move that backfired. He played Booker and Durant too much, wearing out both. The postseason’s hottest player, Booker shot 12 of 32 over Phoenix’s final two games. Rushed and frustrated, Durant was 18 of 43.\n",
      "\n",
      "GO DEEPER Deandre Ayton's future, as ever, is the hot topic for an uncertain Suns offseason\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, Williams’ biggest failure might have centered on Ayton. The two didn’t have the best relationship during their time together. Entering this season, not long after he had signed a four-year, $133 million max extension, Ayton told reporters he had not talked with Williams once over the offseason, which seemed strange given Ayton’s importance. Asked about their relationship Friday, Ayton said it had always been good, adding, “What family don’t argue?”\n",
      "\n",
      "After the Durant trade, Ayton, who has averaged 16.7 points and 10.4 rebounds over five years, became more of a role player. As his touches decreased, so did his aggression. He sat out Game 6 with a rib contusion, leaving the Suns, also without Paul because of a groin strain, severely short-handed. Denver blew open the game with a 17-0 run to end the first quarter. The Suns never recovered, a repeat of their 2022 elimination loss to Dallas — that one coming in Game 7. The lack of competitiveness was as jarring as it was unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ishbia is an aggressive leader. In his book, “Running the Corporate Offense: Lessons in Effective Leadership from the Bench to the Boardroom,” he writes that he’s a big believer in trial by error. That is, “Make a decision and go for it. Make necessary changes along the way.” The first sentence applies to the Durant trade. The Suns made a big decision and went for it. The second applies to Williams’ dismissal.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Phoenix’s championship window possibly closing, Ishbia saw it as the necessary move.\n",

      "So far this year, 348 wildfires have burned more than 25,000 hectares across the province. Christie Tucker, information unit manager with Alberta Wildfire, said most of the fires are believed to be human-caused. Mike Flannigan, a wildfire expert, adds that while the number of human-caused fires is trending down in Canada, lightning-caused fires are on the rise, contributing to an overall increase in the areas burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current wildfire situation in Alberta also reflects changing climate conditions. The province’s busiest fire period tends to happen in May, said Dr. Flannigan, director of the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta. A devastating 2016 fire in Fort McMurray took place during May, the same month a significant fire occurred in Slave Lake in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the time of year when winds, temperatures and other conditions, such as the dryness of the ground, combine to create conditions for extreme fire weather, Dr. Flannigan explains. Such conditions might occur on only a handful of days, but the fires that result tend to be the large ones that result in significant damage to communities or landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Research we have done shows that extreme fire weather is increasing, so it’s only going to get more challenging,” Dr. Flannigan said.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the days after a March 16 fire destroyed an Old Montreal apartment building, killing seven people and injuring nine, the city’s fire department quietly ended a lengthy moratorium on investigations of evacuation routes, a policy that internal documents show had prevented a review of the building’s safety years before the disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire department instituted the moratorium on Oct. 26, 2018, according to an internal memo obtained by The Globe and Mail. The move put a pause on “requests for expertise” related to fire evacuation routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspectors for the fire department send those requests to the department’s technical officers when they think a building is non-compliant with certain safety requirements. The red flags could include things such as dead-end hallways or an insufficient number of exits. After the technical officers weigh in, the fire department can send a building’s owner correction notices, which demand action on whatever deficiencies were identified. If the owner doesn’t comply, the matter might go to court.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, the moratorium meant the fire department had stopped enforcing these safety standards throughout the city, according to two department officials with direct knowledge of how inspections were conducted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Globe is not naming the officials, because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moratorium memo says non-compliant evacuation routes already flagged by inspectors would automatically be given a one-year grace period. It says there is “no need to do an immediate follow-up on violations, because a new deadline will be assigned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Montreal building that burned in deadly fire had repeated safety violations, documents show\n",
      "\n",
      "The memo says management made the decision because of a lack of staff training. It also cites a lack of defined indicators for compliance with regulations, and other issues. The fire department referred questions about this and other matters to the City of Montreal, which declined to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An action plan will be put in place and we will inform you of the steps to be deployed,” the memo says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dead-end hallways and an insufficient number of exits were both issues a fire department inspector named Geneviève Tremblay had identified as early as 2009 in the Old Montreal building, located at the intersection of Place d’Youville and Du Port Street. There is no record in documents obtained by The Globe of those issues ever having been fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents show that in 2018, Ms. Tremblay tried again to focus the fire department’s attention on the building. She requested a review of potential problems with the building’s evacuation routes: the lack of a second exit on the third floor and a dead-end hallway on the second floor. The request was approved by two fire department officials in July, 2018, but denied by a third in September, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technical officer who denied the request cited the moratorium enacted by management three years earlier as his reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two fire department officials who spoke with The Globe said the department lifted the evacuation-route moratorium, as well as a different moratorium on enforcing some regulations related to alarm systems, in the days after the Old Montreal blaze, as a direct result of the catastrophe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robert Rousseau, a section head within the fire department’s prevention division, appeared to confirm this in an April 3 e-mail to staff, which was obtained by The Globe. “Following the major fire of March 16, a crisis unit was set up to begin Operation Vulcain,” he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said inspections had already been carried out, and that inspectors had been instructed to flag “as many non-compliances as possible.” They were also instructed to, among other things, complete training related to evacuation routes and fire alarm systems upgrades, and to flag violations related to those issues during inspections.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a sensitive operation in a highly publicized context. We rely on your usual discretion and professionalism,” Mr. Rousseau concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire department’s moratorium on enforcing some alarm-system regulations – another area of concern in the Old Montreal building – began in 2021 and perhaps even earlier, the documents show.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 3, 2021, two division heads at the fire department, Daniel de Vries and Marcel Deschamps, sent staff a memo announcing a “temporary halt to legal proceedings relating to the upgrading of fire alarm systems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The memo asks inspectors to “no longer address the issue of upgrades during the initial inspection.” This was necessary, Mr. de Vries and Mr. Deschamps explained, because of the municipal court’s decision to “no longer accept our submitted files due to insufficient evidence.” The city did not answer questions about what was meant by this.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as acceptable solutions are in place, we will send them to you,” the memo concludes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2018 moratorium memo on evacuation routes hints that alarm-systems enforcement might have been suspended earlier. “Just like the files concerning fire alarm systems, a structure must be put in place to minimize the impacts and better structure our actions,” it says. The city did not answer a question about when the initial decision to suspend alarm enforcement was made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Documents obtained by The Globe show that Ms. Tremblay had found that the Old Montreal building’s alarm system was not compliant with safety regulations in February, 2019. There were several subsequent interventions with the building’s owner, but the alarm system was still allegedly non-compliant as of Nov. 20, 2020, and the fire department started legal proceedings, according to a report sent to fire department officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another document shows the file was closed on Feb. 3, 2021. There is no record of these alarm-system issues being corrected in any of the documents obtained by The Globe, and there are no related municipal court records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Tremblay declined an interview request. The City of Montreal declined a request for an interview with the city’s fire chief, Richard Liebmann, about the lack of enforcement. “Most of these are court cases, which is why the city will not be commenting,” spokesperson Kim Nantais wrote in an e-mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Montreal building’s owner, Emile-Haim Benamor, did not return multiple requests for comment. His lawyer, Alexandre Bergevin, said he would not comment, considering the fact that Quebec’s chief coroner has ordered a public inquiry into the deaths. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bergevin told The Canadian Press in March that the building’s alarm system had been replaced in 2019 and was regularly tested. Regarding the emergency exits, he said the building had a complex layout. But he claimed it had always been deemed compliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Benamor’s run-ins with inspectors began soon after he bought the building in 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Municipal court records show that he was charged with three infractions relating to evacuation routes in the Old Montreal building in 2010, among other alleged safety violations. He was found guilty of having non-compliant firewall protections and not displaying evacuation plans on every floor, and was fined a total of $714.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he pleaded not guilty to charges related to non-compliant evacuation routes and alarm systems, which were withdrawn in March, 2013, by Judge Martine Leclerc. No further charges have since been filed on these matters at the municipal court.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the alleged violations were being processed by the fire department, the Old Montreal building’s file followed a parallel process with the Régie du bâtiment du Québec (RBQ), which regulates and enforces building construction and safety in the province.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RBQ sent a correction notice to Mr. Benamor on Dec. 27, 2013, about three alleged violations: the lack of a second exit on the third floor, a dead-end hallway on the second floor, and flammable materials used in the interior lining of the exits’ walls and ceilings. Mr. Benamor was granted a 30-day period to correct them.\n",
      "\n",
      "These safety issues were first identified in November, 2009, by Ms. Tremblay, of the fire department, and a city inspector, records show. Ms. Tremblay sent a complaint about them to the RBQ in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RBQ has refused to share any documents related to the building. RBQ spokesperson Sylvain Lamothe previously said the building’s file had been transferred to a Crown prosecutor. He said the RBQ would not comment further out of respect for the investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RBQ correction notice was released to Ms. Tremblay after she filed an access-to-information request. In the RBQ’s June 26, 2018, response to her request, it says the building is still non-compliant, nearly a decade after Ms. Tremblay’s initial inspection. “There is a possibility of prosecution in this case,” RBQ official Mélanie Drainville said in the response, which The Globe obtained through a third party.\n"

      "\n",
      "Thousands more people were ordered to evacuate their homes in Northern Alberta on Sunday, as raging wildfires continued to burn homes, vehicles and thousands of hectares of forest, all the while straining the firefighting resources of local communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "With unseasonably high temperatures expected to last at least another day, and no sign of rain in sight for a week, authorities said the situation remains dangerous and in flux.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The wildfire situation is extremely volatile,” said Colin Blair, executive director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, during a news conference. “Hot and dry conditions throughout much of Alberta present an ever-increasing risk of new wildfires starting, and the potential for current wildfires to grow quickly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 19,000 people were under evacuation orders throughout the province, Mr. Blair said. This was thousands more than the previous day, but down from a peak of around 31,000 earlier this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The province has not specified the exact number of homes destroyed in the fires. There were 87 active fires Sunday afternoon, including 24 deemed out of control, said Josée St-Onge, a spokesperson for Alberta Wildfire. That is up from 76 active wildfires on Friday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "As firefighters from other provinces and from the United States were deployed to the area, along with Canadian Armed Forces personnel, there were more calls from residents and local leaders to either delay the upcoming May 29 Alberta election or make accommodations for affected residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although evacuation orders are expected to be lifted by that date, some are learning they have nothing to come back to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the week and a half since a wildfire swallowed her home in Drayton Valley, 150 kilometres west of Edmonton, much of Kathryn Tarnasky’s days have been spent compiling the contents’ list for her insurance claim – an emotional task.\n",
      "\n",
      "She can only do a bit at a time before her eyes cloud with tears and she has to take a break. Building the list of the possessions she and her family lost involves scrolling through the thousands of photos she has saved on her phone since she and her husband, Chris, purchased the property in May, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are things that will never be the same,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Chris Tarnasky (30), Kathryn Tarnasky (29), Bennett Tarnasky (9), Kerryn Tarnasky (2) and Halle Tarnasky (1.5).Handout\n",
      "\n",
      "Early on May 4, the Tarnaskys, along with others in Drayton Valley, received an evacuation order. The family, which includes three children, piled into their camper van with only a few possessions to go to Ms. Tarnasky’s mother’s house in Alder Flats, 30 minutes away, assuming they could come back in a few days to pick up the rest. They could not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their family vehicle was reduced to a burnt-out shell, and because recent upgrades done to the car to qualify it for fire insurance had not yet been certified by a mechanic, it’s unlikely their insurer will cover it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friends set up a crowd-sourcing fund to help the Tarnaskys buy another vehicle but as for the rest of their possessions? “Money can’t replace all that,” Ms. Tarnasky said.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, 456 wildfires in the province have burned more than 520,000 hectares this year, more than 1,000 times bigger than the area burned at this time last year, according to the Alberta Wildfire Status Dashboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our peak burning period, which is when the temperatures are at their highest and the fuels are at their driest, is still in front of us,” Ms. St-Onge said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate hazards, including heatwaves and wildfire activity, have already intensified across North American and that is projected to continue, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body of hundreds of climate scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the rest of her community, Danielle Bourgeois evacuated Rainbow Lake, in northwestern Alberta, on May 6. She is staying with five friends and their six cats in High Level, about 140 kilometres to the east, and said other Rainbow Lake residents settled in campgrounds around town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday night, the evacuees held a barbecue to boost morale. “As the days go on, we’re not necessarily getting bad news but it’s not good news either, so it was really just nice to see people come together,” Ms. Bourgeois said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, with the continuing uncertainty, she does not think she and her neighbours are in a good place to cast their ballots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Postponing the provincial election would be “a good idea given the current state of Alberta right now,” she said. “With so many people displaced from their homes, it’s going to make it more difficult for them to be sure to get out and get their votes in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wade Williams, mayor of Yellowhead County, west of Edmonton, said there had been delays in the provincial government response to the wildfires, including the introduction of a fire ban and the declaration of a state of emergency, because provincial ministers had not been in their offices and were focused on the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking on CBC’s Rosemary Barton Live on Sunday, Mr. Williams said there were “a lot of upset people right now” and a postponement was the right thing to do, given that the fires will likely be an election issue, and a lot of people won’t go out and vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta’s Chief Electoral Officer has the power to delay voting at polling stations because of fires or other disasters, or to move voting to a different place on election day. If this is insufficient, the Chief Electoral Officer can apply to the court to halt the election in affected areas and restart voting at another time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This could lead to a delay in the outcome of the entire provincial election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nancy Dodds, mayor of Drayton Valley, and Raymond Supernault, chairman of the East Prairie Métis Settlement in Northern Alberta, agreed the election should be postponed. “Do the people really want to go out to vote right now? Is that the first thing on your mind? No,” Mr. Supernault told Ms. Barton on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Canadian Armed Forces have deployed a response unit of around 300 personnel divided between Drayton Valley, Grand Prairie and Fox Creek to support firefighters and facilitate the evacuation of isolated communities for two weeks – three if needed – the Department of National Defence said.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 1,500 firefighters have been deployed in the province, including personnel from the U.S. and elsewhere in Canada. “We are using all of the resources at our disposal,” Ms. St-Onge said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the resources don’t match the needs everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian Cornforth, fire chief of Parkland County, just west of Edmonton, said “extreme circumstances” led him to privately hire firefighting crews from British Columbia because no more resources were available in Alberta. The crews he hired are separate from the out-of-province resources brought in by the Alberta government to fight higher priority fires, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s exceptional for us, and I know all the other communities are looking for the same resources. And the province is doing their very best to find those resources,” Chief Cornforth said. But it takes time, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada warned in a statement Sunday that wildfire smoke “is causing poor air quality and reduced visibility in many areas” of Northern Alberta.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wildfire smoke can be harmful to everyone’s health even at low concentrations,” the statement said, adding that people with lung or heart disease, seniors, children and those who are pregnant were at higher risk, along with those who work outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada advised people to monitor for symptoms such as shortness of breath or coughing, to stay inside if possible, and to use N95 respirator masks to reduce exposure to the fine particles in smoke.\n"

As of Saturday, there were 83 active fires in the province, including 21 deemed out of control. That is up from 76 active wildfires on Friday afternoon.\n",

Approximately 16,520 people remained under evacuation orders throughout the province, and that the risk of new wildfires was high for the next few days. People should be prepared to evacuate on short notice with essentials already packed, said Bre Hutchinson of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, 443 wildfires in the province have burned close to 470,000 hectares this year, over 1,000 times more than the area burned at this time last year, according to the Alberta Wildfire Status Dashboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 1,500 firefighters have been deployed in the province, including 300 from Parks Canada, British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Yukon, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Oregon and Alaska. Another 200 firefighters from the U.S. are on their way, according to Josée St-Onge, a spokesperson with Alberta Wildfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Alberta government is providing one-time emergency financial assistance to residents who have been forced out of their homes. Adults who have been displaced, by official order, for at least seven consecutive days are to receive $1,250, in addition to $500 for each dependent child under the age of 18, said Ms. Smith during a news conference on Monday afternoon. Payments will be provided through an e-transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 7, Premier Danielle Smith met with NDP Leader Rachel Notley, who governed the province when the Fort McMurray fire prompted tens of thousands to evacuate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the evacuation orders that have affected the northern half of the province over the past 10 days have been rescinded, but residents may be forced from their homes again if fires reignite or spread. John Craig, a meteorologist with the federal Environment Department, said the risk of more fires is high, with forests and fields already tinder-dry. “Low winds, very little precipitation and warmer-than-average temperatures. That’s what we’re expecting,” Mr. Craig said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Residents in some parts of Grande Prairie have been allowed to return home, but the Grande Prairie Regional Emergency Partnership, which co-ordinates responses to disasters in the area, has said they need to be prepared to evacuate again if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hot, dry weather is due partly to a high-pressure system that isn’t expected to break down any time soon, he explained. The heat may approach seasonal records. Temperatures on Monday are expected to be in the low 30s, nearing the highest May temperature ever recorded at the Edmonton airport, 32.8 C.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Northern Alberta, Chief Conroy Sewepagaham of Little Red River Cree Nation, which has seen some of the worst damage, said 85 homes have been destroyed in the community that is made up of Fox Lake, John D’Or Prairie, and Garden River.\n",

      "What caused the wildfires in Alberta\n",
      "\n",
      "So far this year, 348 wildfires have burned more than 25,000 hectares across the province. Christie Tucker, information unit manager with Alberta Wildfire, said most of the fires are believed to be human-caused. Mike Flannigan, a wildfire expert, adds that while the number of human-caused fires is trending down in Canada, lightning-caused fires are on the rise, contributing to an overall increase in the areas burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current wildfire situation in Alberta also reflects changing climate conditions. The province’s busiest fire period tends to happen in May, said Dr. Flannigan, director of the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at the University of Alberta. A devastating 2016 fire in Fort McMurray took place during May, the same month a significant fire occurred in Slave Lake in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the time of year when winds, temperatures and other conditions, such as the dryness of the ground, combine to create conditions for extreme fire weather, Dr. Flannigan explains. Such conditions might occur on only a handful of days, but the fires that result tend to be the large ones that result in significant damage to communities or landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Research we have done shows that extreme fire weather is increasing, so it’s only going to get more challenging,” Dr. Flannigan said.\n",

      "\n",
      "The board of a non-profit housing organization in B.C. that has been criticized in a recent forensic audit is refusing to fire its executive director, despite being urged to do so by the provincial government agency that is its major funder.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement Tuesday and in correspondence released by the BC United Party, the board of Atira Women’s Resource Society flatly rejected calls to dismiss CEO Janice Abbott following the release of a report that found Atira’s financial records were incomplete or late and that some purchases worth millions of dollars were done without approvals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audit, released Monday, also found the former CEO of BC Housing – the agency that funds Atira and other non-profits to provide housing to the province’s most vulnerable – had breached conflict-of-interest rules multiple times by communicating with BC Housing staff about contracts that were directed to Atira. The former CEO, Shayne Ramsay, is married to Ms. Abbott.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the audit did not find that either Mr. Ramsay or Ms. Abbott benefited financially from the breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a letter to the Atira board sent last Thursday, the new chair of BC Housing, Allan Seckel, made it plain Ms. Abbott should go.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Given the investigation’s findings, the current leadership is not able to make the necessary and significant changes required. I reiterate our view that leadership renewal is required to ensure Atira works with BC Housing in a manner consistent with its operating agreements.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But all the members of the Atira board signed a letter last week refusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In light of there being no findings of wrongdoing by anyone on its executive, Atira’s board will not terminate its senior executive team or any of its members on request from BC Housing with one day’s notice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Atira board members include a lawyer at a prominent blue-chip Vancouver firm; the chief operating officer of a major development company; a former managing director of the accounting firm that conducted the audit on Atira; and the wife of the NDP’s Forests Minister Bruce Ralston.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letters were made public by the BC United Party, the province’s Official Opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although non-profit boards are not subject to government orders, the province could force compliance by withholding money for future operations.\n",

      "\n",
      "B.C.’s non-profit housing providers worry they may be in government crosshairs\n",
      "\n",
      "The Atira board also questioned the audit findings, saying in a news release Tuesday there are errors in the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter exchange happened late last week, a few days before Premier David Eby and Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon released the Ernst & Young forensic investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ramsay and the province had established a protocol in 2011 to prevent conflict-of-interest problems by keeping him at arm’s length from any decisions involving his wife’s non-profit. But the auditors, who seized laptops, cellphones and databases as part of the investigation, said there were multiple indications that Mr. Ramsay had sent directions to staff about Atira projects and that he had deleted many text messages in what appeared to be an effort to avoid detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Atira saw its funding from BC Housing go from $21.2-million in 2018 to $74.1-million in 2022. It houses about 3,000 people in 28 buildings, along with running daycares and other support programs, largely for vulnerable women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Eby said Atira’s funding has been frozen at current levels until there is a more complete review undertaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Atira board also declined to immediately return $1.9-million in surplus from 2021 that Mr. Seckel requested, saying it would do that when that year’s financial review was complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kahlon expressed shock Tuesday that the board had responded so negatively, saying the organization was showing a lack of concern about serious problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s unclear what Atira’s future is given the NDP government’s strong criticism. Atira is the province’s largest organization of its kind and was the go-to for BC Housing, but also for others, including the City of Vancouver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vancouver has provided Atira with about $4.5-million in grants over the past 10 years, including $1.2-million in 2014 to develop the Olivia Skye private rental and social-housing apartments on East Hastings. It approved a grant of $350,000 in 2016 for a project on Hawks Avenue, but that hasn’t been paid out because Atira has been unable to get all the financing it needs in that case.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is one of at least two projects that Atira was trying to develop in recent years but which stalled because of a financing shortfall. BC Housing was not able to provide a list immediately of other Atira construction projects that might be affected.\n"

I wasn’t there to learn how to protect myself or my family. I was there to learn what was taught in the classes themselves, which a broad coalition of groups — including many police officers, Republican and Democratic legislators and gun violence prevention organizations — have hailed as a path out of the nation’s epidemic of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found something very different. The classes I attended trained students to believe that their lives are in constant danger. They prepared us to shoot without hesitation and avoid legal consequences. They instilled the kind of fear that has a corrosive effect on all interactions — and beyond that, on the fabric of our democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took 42 classes and conducted interviews with 52 instructors and 118 students, in traditionally red states like Texas as well as blue states like Massachusetts, in urban areas like Newark as well as rural Southern Illinois. (The instructors knew I was there to conduct research; in keeping with my university’s academic protocols, I had permission to take notes in class and to record interviews but not to publish anyone’s names.) Most of all, I immersed myself in firearms schools in Texas, where I live, that cater to people who wish to learn how to use guns for self-defense. Some instructors in these schools told me they have been involved in drafting public safety protocols or running active shooter drills for public school teachers. Some of these instructors’ students have gone on to open training programs of their own.\n",

Philadelphia's Eastern Conference semifinals loss marked its sixth straight year of reaching the postseason but failing to advance past the second round.https://t.co/78mSVJmvU8 pic.twitter.com/Mo9xTdWFyx — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) May 16, 2023\n",

      "The Athletic’s instant analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "What this says about Sixers’ ownership\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many reasons that the Sixers let go of Rivers, and the precedent with this ownership group was already there. Brett Brown got three legitimate chances to take the Joel Embiid-led Sixers past the second round of the playoffs, and when he failed to do so, he was let go in 2020. After the Sixers’ Game 7 debacle in Boston on Sunday, Rivers found himself in the same situation: 0 for 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasonable minds can disagree about how much Rivers was at fault in a series that saw his best two players struggle in the most important moments, but he was brought to Philadelphia to take the Sixers further than they had been. That did not happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is still a ton of uncertainty heading into the offseason, but firing the coach is always the easiest lever to pull. Bringing Rivers back after three playoff flameouts was untenable. Rivers said after Game 7 that he planned on being back, but by that point, the writing was on the wall. He still had two years left on his contract. — Hofmann\n",
      "\n",
      "What Philadelphia’s stars said about Rivers\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about Rivers after the Sixers lost Game 7, the team’s two star players gave different answers. Embiid called Rivers “fantastic,” saying, “You look at the way he handled the whole (Ben Simmons) situation that we had a year or two ago, he kept the team afloat. He’s been a great leader for all of us, a great motivator.”\n",
      "\n",
      "James Harden took a different tact when asked if the coach should return, simply saying, “Our relationship is OK.” It felt like a telling, brief answer in the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Harden looming as a free agent this summer, and potentially a flight risk to Houston, it did not seem like both Harden and Rivers would be back with the Sixers next year. Now the question turns to whether either will be back. — Hofmann\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Philadelphia looking for in a replacement?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s worth noting that this will be Daryl Morey’s first official coaching hire with the Sixers, as Rivers was brought on a few weeks before Morey officially took the president of basketball operations job in the whirlwind 2020 offseason. As long as Embiid is on the roster, the likeliest outcome is that the Sixers will turn to a coach with experience to try to get the roster over the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Just in the past few weeks, three coaches with NBA Finals experience (Nick Nurse, Mike Budenholzer, Monty Williams) hit the coaching market. Williams was an assistant in Philadelphia under Brown. Mike D’Antoni has always loomed as a candidate given his ties to Morey and Harden, and he had a brief spell as a Sixers assistant during one of Embiid’s redshirt years at the beginning of his career. And there are other names with experience as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever the Sixers do end up hiring, he will be judged on his playoff record. Rivers’ regular-season record with the Sixers was good enough, especially under some adverse circumstances. Embiid took his game to another level in the past three years. But they continued to fall short in the playoffs. — Hofmann\n",
      "\n",
      "Backstory\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivers, 61, was hired by Philadelphia in 2020 with the expectation that his championship experience would help the Sixers advance past the postseason hurdles they faced under previous coach Brown. Instead, those shortcomings continued despite significant roster overhauls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Rivers, the 76ers traded Simmons to the Nets in a deal for Harden, Embiid developed into an MVP, Tyrese Maxey was drafted and developed into a reliable 20-point scorer and the team rounded out its roster with veterans such as P.J. Tucker, Montrezl Harrell and Jalen McDaniels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dating to 2008, when Rivers was coaching Boston, teams led by him reached the playoffs in 15 of 16 seasons. But not since 2010, when the Celtics reached the NBA Finals, has a Rivers-led team advanced past the second round.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivers stepped down as coach of the Clippers in 2020 after the team lost in the semifinals. The next year, under new coach Ty Lue, LA reached its first conference finals in franchise history.\n",
      "\n",
      "What they’re saying\n",
      "\n",
      "Morey called Rivers “one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, a future Hall of Famer, and someone I respect immensely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise,” Morey said. “After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Though there’s interest in building energy storage across the country, very little capacity exists today. Ontario currently has only 220 MW, which includes the 175-MW Ontario Power Generation’s Sir Adam Beck Pump Generating Station, built in 1957. The IESO says it will increase that capacity more than fourfold by 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Energy storage makes the grid stable,” said Justin Rangooni, executive director of Energy Storage Canada, an industrial lobby group. “It’s critical that we continue to grow that number.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Rangooni said Ontario’s new projects will likely rely on lithium-ion batteries, the most economical technology for short-term storage.

      "\n",
      "The IESO forecasts Ontario will need 2,500 MW of new capacity by 2026, Mr. Farmer said, but seeks to procure as much as 4,000 MW to address the risk that some projects might not be completed on schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its latest long-term reliability assessment published in December, the NERC said Ontario faces shortfalls of 1,700 megawatts in each of 2025 and 2026. That would be reduced if Ontario is able to continue operating the Pickering station beyond 2025. In September, the Ontario government asked OPG to continue operating the plant into 2026, which would require approval from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.\n",

      "The IESO did not reveal pricing details for its latest procurements, but promised to do so soon.

      "The question\n",
      "\n",
      "I was recruited into a new role and quit my previous job to take the new one. Unfortunately, I was let go one month into a three-month probation period. Does this mean I’m not entitled to any severance or compensation? What are my options?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Shibil Siddiqi, partner, Progressive Barristers, Toronto\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ontario, employees terminated less than three months into their employment are not entitled to any notice or compensation under Ontario’s Employment Standards Act (ESA). However, probationary periods do not arise from legislation; they are established by the employment contract. Probationary periods longer than three months attract ESA protections. And in some circumstances, even shorter-term probationary employees may receive compensation under the common law or the Ontario Human Rights Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some employment contracts provide for set compensation upon termination. Most contain termination clauses that purport to restrict compensation to minimum ESA entitlements. Fortunately for employees, not all termination clauses are valid and enforceable. Termination clauses are void if they try to limit entitlements or rights under the ESA or if their meaning is ambiguous.\n",
      "\n",
      "A void termination clause entitles employees to common law reasonable notice (or pay in lieu thereof) upon termination. Such compensation is usually minimal for short-term employment. However, it can be more significant for employees in senior or highly specialized positions, or where employees have few other opportunities in the job market. Greater notice may also be provided where an employer used undue pressure tactics to induce an employee to quit a secure job to take up a new position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, regardless of the employment contract and ESA, an employee may be entitled to compensation if a ground protected by the Human Rights Code, such as race, gender or disability, was a factor in the termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interpretation of termination clauses can be a highly technical exercise and most employees can benefit from some legal advice on their options following termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Josh Hobbs, employment lawyer, Purnell Employment Law, Calgary\n",
      "\n",
      "You raise a valid concern. Given the three-month probation, and the fact you were terminated during that probation, you won’t be entitled to statutory severance. That’s because, in most provinces, employers are not required to pay statutory severance if they terminate an employee within 90 days. However, if a court were to find that the second employer induced you away from your previous job, then you may be entitled to common law severance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inducement is when an employer offers someone certain perks or promises to convince them to quit a secure, well-paying job and join their company. These can be things like a higher salary, better benefits or improved working conditions that aren’t normally offered to other employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a terminated employee can show that they wouldn’t have joined the company without these inducements, a court may award a greater amount of severance than what they would have otherwise received. The amount of this severance would depend on whether the previous job was secure and the extent of the employer’s efforts in attempting to recruit the individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you can establish that your employer had induced you to quit a secure, well-paying job, then you may be entitled to common law severance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to your options, we recommend discussing your situation in greater detail with an employment lawyer who specializes in working with employees. As the above explanation is only cursory, a consult is necessary in order to properly advise you of your rights and options.\n",

      "The Alberta election campaign continues, even as the government deals with wildfires burning in the north and western parts of the province that have forced nearly 30,000 people to evacuate and destroyed dozens of homes and buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Premier Danielle Smith declared a provincial state of emergency late Saturday afternoon, it was expected she would step back from campaigning as United Conservative Party leader to make sure the focus was on keeping Albertans safe and that the fires could be contained as quickly as possible. Same went for NDP Leader Rachel Notley, whose party had a number of candidates announce they were stepping off the campaign trail in their wildfire affected ridings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice things are much more complicated than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of an election campaign, it’s awfully hard to just flip a switch and turn off the politics. And to the casual observer, you wouldn’t know whether news conferences were being run by the government or by the party – hence the mishmash of questions and answers being asked of the two leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Ms. Smith did speak with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about federal support and also sat down with Ms. Notley to brief her on the wildfire situation, both sides were quick to get back to the race to win the May 29 election.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a news conference Monday, the Alberta government announced wildfire relief payments for people and their dependents forced from their homes for more than seven days. By Tuesday, Ms. Smith said she would consider changing eligibility rules after complaints about how long one needed to be out of their home to qualify.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Notley, for her part, toured the Expo Centre in Edmonton where some evacuees were staying on the weekend. And on Monday she made an announcement about protecting Alberta pensions and better funding for home care.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the biggest headache of the week for Ms. Smith had nothing to do with campaign announcements or wildfire funding. A video emerged on the weekend in which she compared those who got the COVID-19 vaccine to people who supported tyrants, referencing Adolf Hitler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Smith made the comments in a podcast with an accompanying video on Nov. 10, 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UCP Leader has tried to back away from controversial statements before. After her first news conference as premier, for example, she said those who chose not to get vaccinated were the most discriminated against people in her lifetime. But this time she was forced to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Smith, who became the leader of the UCP after campaigning on COVID-19 grievances, has previously argued she should not be judged on comments she made as a talk-radio host, columnist or lobbyist. (It should be noted a prospective candidate for the UCP was dumped for very similar comments last fall.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The comments, which prompted a response from the Canadian Legion, as well as prominent Jewish organizations, are the latest distraction in a tight election that could come down to a handful of ridings and a few thousand votes.\n",
      "\n",

      "['Radheyan Simonpillai'] 2023-05-16 06:30:00-04:00 Open this photo in gallery: Director Zarrar Kahn's Pakistan-set horror movie In Flames is representing our national cinema at the Cannes Film Festival, which runs May 16 through 27.Christopher Katsarov/The Globe and Mail\n",
      "\n",
      "Canadian cinema feels like it’s on fire. Matt Johnson’s rebelliously entertaining BlackBerry – think The Big Short with Timbits – is earning raves as it plays theatres across North America. Meanwhile, Zarrar Kahn’s riveting Pakistan-set horror movie In Flames is representing our national cinema at the Cannes Film Festival, which runs May 16 through 27.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these titles are pushing what Canadian cinema can be – and as different as they are, the films share a distant connection. In Flames is the first film playing Cannes to come out of Talent to Watch, the Telefilm funding stream dedicated to first-time feature filmmakers, which BlackBerry director Johnson and his producing partner Matthew Miller had a hand in shaping. Their retooling of the microbudget program would disburse funds widely among novice filmmakers, whose projects are chosen by an independent, diverse selection committee, instead of an appointed gatekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Flames stars newcomer Ramesha Nawal as Mariam, a young woman coping with personal trauma and culturally ingrained misogyny that hangs thick in the Karachi air. The film is put together with the intense craft and torque we saw in Ari Aster’s Hereditary, but with more heart and conviction. It’s the outcome of the investment of Talent to Watch in new voices and the conversations about race and privilege that transpired in 2020, when Telefilm engaged with groups like BIPOC Film & TV, compelling a rethink about the narratives that Canada wants to tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re seeing this expansion of what it means to be Canadian cinema right now with films like Riceboy Sleeps and This Place,” Kahn says on a Zoom call from his Toronto apartment, a week before heading to France, where his film will play in the prestigious Directors’ Fortnight section. His “secret hope” is for this expansion to mean more funds for Talent to Watch, hence more empowerment for first-time filmmakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kahn, thoughtful and soft-spoken, is on the call alongside In Flames producer Anam Abbas, dialed in from her apartment in Islamabad.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’re going to be joining a sizeable Canadian delegation in the French Riviera. Quebec’s Monia Chokri, the actor-turned-director who recently scored a Best Picture nomination at the Canadian Screen Awards for her comedy Babysitter, is putting the final touches on her latest, Simple comme Sylvain. The rom-com starring Magalie Lépine Blondeau and Pierre-Yves Cardinal premieres in Cannes’s Un Certain Regard section, where Chokri won a jury prize in 2019 for her debut feature, A Brother’s Love. Fellow Quebecois filmmaker Justine Harbonnier will present her documentary Caiti Blues in the ACID sidebar. The lovely, low-key portrait following musician Caiti Lord, whose joyous singing weathers the storm that is life in America, just scored the DGC Special Jury Prize at Hot Docs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are even more Canadians appearing on screen at Cannes: Tantoo Cardinal in Martin Scorsese’s long-awaited crime drama Killers of the Flower Moon; Abel “The Weeknd” Tesfaye and Dan Levy in HBO’s The Idol; and David Cronenberg and Chokri, alongside a slate of other celebrated international filmmakers in the talking-head doc Chambre 999. The latter film is a discussion on the future of film, which is top of mind for Kahn and Abbas, for both Canada and Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter doesn’t have a large film industry with locals often consuming Bollywood fare. The shorts and docs Kahn and Abbas have been making there for a decade are not just changing what Canadian cinema can look like – they’re also shaping Pakistan’s onscreen voice in its infancy, while resisting the “imperialist” influence that tends to frame the Muslim world a certain way.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Flames, their first collaboration, builds on the characters and themes in Kahn’s 2018 short Dia. In the early film, a young woman named Mariam pursues a secret online romance, finding an escape from her family’s pressures before things take a dark turn. “I was developing that film, which I thought was going to be a drama,” says Kahn. “It ended up being like a thriller. There was fear that was just coming out of the reality of the characters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For In Flames, Kahn developed the narrative further, absorbing intimate stories he was receiving from the women around him, including Abbas; attending workshops and script labs to get input from such filmmakers as Mouly Surya (Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts), who is often dubbed Indonesia’s Tarantino; and taking inspiration from filmmakers including Julia Ducournau (Titane), Mati Diop (Atlantics) and Jordan Peele (Get Out), who are taking up space in a genre that a few decades ago didn’t include voices like theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kahn came out of the other end of development with a visceral movie about a woman haunted by specters from the past, while the misogyny around her feels like it can come crashing through a window at any moment. There are some similarities to Alex Garland’s film Men, as Mariam deals with the spectrum of hatred, in domestic and institutional spaces, whether from a random man on the street or a purportedly close ally, in the film’s most pervasive moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lot of allyship can be patronizing,” says Abbas, discussing characters in the film who show up like white knights, their generosity or civility packaged with entitlement and expectation. “The idea of men protecting women is such a deeply entrenched part of our culture. What are the consequences of that kind of societal structure where that is the expectation? When it’s not there, what happens?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of moping around and trembling her way throughout an oppressive film – the trendy characteristic among her “elevated horror” counterparts in such films as The Babadook – Mariam is feisty, constantly fighting for joy and romance, seizing on the little reprieves to let her charm break free. When things take a toll, she doesn’t snap so much as she snaps back. For Kahn, those traits are meant to be emblematic of the film as a whole, and its setting, Karachi.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a city that’s been through so much pain and so much terror. But it still has these micro moments of joy,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While there is trauma and terror in her life, it doesn’t define Mariam. Her resilience is what I want audiences to walk away with. Her ability to overcome the past.”\n",

      "['Hiroko Tabuchi'] 2023-05-17 00:00:00 What It Means: Fires are sending oil prices higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "The damage to oil and gas production was likely to significantly surpass current tallies, Thomas Liles, vice president of Rystad’s upstream research, said in a note. A large part of Alberta’s shale gas producing regions remained under “extreme” or “very high” wildfire warnings. Another 2.7 million barrels a day of oil sands production was also at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disruptions from the fires in Canada, a major oil- and gas-producing nation, have helped push oil prices higher. Chevron said it had shut down all production at its Kaybob Duvernay oil and gas fields in central Alberta. Paramount temporarily shuttered a natural gas processing plant along with production in several gas fields, the company said in its latest update on Sunday. Both companies said they were prioritizing the safety of their workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background: Oil and gas are also vulnerable to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn’t the first time Canada’s oil and gas fields have been hit by fires, and the shutdowns, for now, affect a small proportion of the country’s total oil and gas output. Still, they underscore how the production of oil and gas, the main driver of climate change, is also vulnerable to the increasingly dire consequences of a warming planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As climate change intensifies, the risk of devastating wildfires around the world will surge, the United Nations warned in a landmark report last year. Researchers found that in regions with long histories of wildfires, like the western United States and Canada, the burning has become larger and more intense over the last decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fires come amid a multiyear drought and much warmer temperatures than are normal in western Canada, which climate scientists attribute to climate change. And in recent years, Alberta has been more affected by climate-related disasters than almost any other part of the country, including severe floods in 2013, a previous round of devastating wildfires in 2016 and thunderstorms that brought billions of dollars in damage in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it’s hard to say how much climate disasters will affect Canada’s oil and gas industry, the country can expect more shutdowns, said Ryan Ness, director of adaptation research at the nonprofit Canadian Climate Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Canada is in a difficult situation in that the oil and gas industry has been a very important part of our economy for a long time,” Mr. Ness said. “But the reality is that the world has to shift away from fossil fuels and meet our greenhouse emissions targets, or else the types of extreme weather and wildfires and the like we’re seeing will just become unsurvivable.”\n"

      "['David Wallace-Wells'] 2023-05-17 00:00:00 In Western Canada, fire season comes early by American standards — beginning, usually, right around now. In Alberta, by today’s date, only about 1,000 acres have burned in recent years. This season so far, the total is already more than 1.5 million — which would make it the province’s third-worst annual result, just a few weeks into May, with months more of wildfire season still to burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, by contrast, those who live in fear of wildfire are probably breathing a bit easier. Last year was a relatively light one, with fewer than eight million acres burning across the country — close to the two-decade average and well below the damage of several especially scarring recent seasons. This year looks potentially even milder, thanks to the onslaught of “atmospheric rivers” along the West Coast, which many Californians experienced as extreme weather whiplash but which also supercharged the state’s depleted snowpack, turned millions of drought-browned acres a verdant green and at least for a time managed to substitute the fear of flooding, in California’s quasi-apocalyptic ecological imagination, for fear of fire. For now there may be out-of-control blazes burning in Alberta, 2,000 miles away, but to most on the American side of the border, they are out of sight and out of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a new lesson from the evolving science of wildfire is about how far its toxic smoke spreads and how widely its noxious impacts are distributed. You may think of fire in terms of scorched homes and go bags sitting ready for sudden evacuation. But distance is no cordon sanitaire for smoke. In fact, according to one not-yet-published study led by Stanford researchers exploring the distribution of wildfire smoke, an estimated 60 percent of the smoke impact of American wildfire is experienced by those living outside the states where the trees are in flames. Eighty-seven percent of the impact is experienced by those living outside the county of the original fire. And the problem is getting much worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, a new generation of California fires have taught us their own new vocabulary: “gigafires,” for fires burning a million or more acres; “fire tornadoes,” for blazes burning intensely enough to create their own dramatic weather systems; the “pyrocene age,” for the current global era defined by fires. Perhaps more memorably, we are now haunted by a new visual vocabulary, too: a town called Paradise incinerated in hours, amber urban skyscapes and whole cities navigating darkness at noon, dashcam evacuations through walls of flame.\n"

      "['Joe Vardon'] 2023-05-17 00:00:00 Within 24 hours of losing his job in Los Angeles nearly three years ago, Doc Rivers was on a flight to Philadelphia to interview for his next one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivers leapfrogged one of his assistants and chief protégé Tyronn Lue to become the next coach of the 76ers because Sixers star Joel Embiid preferred how Rivers intended to use Embiid in the offense. Embiid also was leery of Lue’s perceived ties to Ben Simmons through his closeness to Rich Paul and Klutch Sports — who at the time was managing Simmons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, none of these items are news. The neck-snapping speed with which Rivers became a candidate in Philadelphia after he and the Clippers said goodbye was immediately obvious. And I’d previously reported the Embiid-Rivers, Lue-Simmons angle on the eve of Rivers’ first season with the Sixers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the history of how Rivers got the job in Philadelphia, what transpired over his three seasons there and that he’s out of a job now — while three other marquee coaches who have all been fired within the last month or so are prime candidates to replace him — are all excellent examples of the absurdity with which most of organizations treat the head-coaching position in the modern NBA.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the NBA’s owners want to wrestle away some of the enormous power the players hold over teams, they would do well to reset the nonsensical coaching carousel that has spun out of control to the point where Rivers, Monty Williams, Mike Budenholzer and Nick Nurse could end up replacing one another before the summer even begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hours after Rivers’ firing was announced I spoke with three NBA front-office executives — two in the Western Conference and one in the Eastern Conference — who expressed somewhere between skepticism and outright doubt that Rivers would get another job for the upcoming season. But then one pointed to the unpredictability of the situation in Phoenix, where new owner Mat Ishbia has traded for Kevin Durant and fired Williams, and another mentioned Rivers as a potential sleeper candidate in Milwaukee, and around we go again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s first close the loop on Rivers’ time with the Sixers.\n",
      "\n",
      "GO DEEPER For Doc Rivers and others, being an NBA coach has never been easy\n",
      "\n",
      "Embiid, who for the sake of argument here favored Rivers, proceeded to enjoy the best three seasons of his NBA career. He was statistically and aesthetically dominant enough in those three campaigns to be runner-up for MVP twice and then finally won the award this season with back-to-back league-scoring titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, the Sixers lost in the conference semifinals in each season. In 2021, they dropped a Game 7 to the Atlanta Hawks. Simmons refused to shoot the ball in the fourth quarter and never played another game for the Sixers. In 2022, James Harden’s first with Rivers, the Sixers were beaten in six games by the Miami Heat. Embiid battled through a broken thumb, and Harden refused to take a shot in the second half of the deciding game.\n",
      "\n",
      "And because it just happened, we all remember the Sixers’ 2023 flameout, coughing up a 3-2 series lead to the Celtics and getting blown out in Game 7, with Harden and Embiid playing terribly in the series decider.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sixers fired Rivers after losing two Game 7s in his three seasons. He is 6-10 in his career in such games, and the 10 Game 7 defeats are easily the most in NBA history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we pass judgment on Rivers in Philadelphia, let’s take a peek at how his old team has done since he and the Clippers “mutually part(ed) ways,” as it was deemed by the team in 2020. Rivers was not coming back after blowing a 3-1 series lead in the second round to Denver that season in the NBA bubble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Lue, the Clippers broke through to the Western Conference finals in 2021, failed to make the playoffs in 2022 and were out in the first round this season. Kawhi Leonard tore up his knee in the ’21 Western semis, didn’t play at all the following season and appeared in precisely two playoff games this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe Lue is one of the best coaches in the league and I should note we maintain a close working relationship. But if we’re being fair to all coaches who get fired because they don’t reach the finals, on average, the Clippers haven’t done much better with Ty than they did with Doc. And the Sixers, on average, have gone deeper in the playoffs the last three seasons than the Clippers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Being fired is part of the job as a coach of a professional sports franchise, especially in the NBA. Of the last five coaches to win the finals, four have since been fired. They are Lue (won in 2016, fired in fall of ’18), Nurse (won in 2019, fired in April), Frank Vogel (won in 2020, fired in ’22) and Budenholzer (won in 2021, fired last week).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lue steered Cleveland to three consecutive finals. LeBron James left for the Lakers in the summer of 2018, and after an 0-6 start the following season, the Cavs fired Lue. To this day, Lue and I disagree with each other over whether the firing was prudent. I contend he’d openly defied his superiors in protest over the Cavs shifting into a rebuild when they said they weren’t doing that. Fair or not, it was grounds for firing. Lue still contends he didn’t deserve it because of all he’d done for the franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nurse, after his title, was thrust into as difficult a situation as any championship coach. He lost his star player — Leonard — immediately, and then, after the 2020 NBA bubble season, had to coach the entirety of the following season on the road because Canada’s COVID-19 pandemic rules essentially prohibited the Raptors from playing home games. This was the first year the Raptors failed to make the playoffs under Nurse, and it seemed like both sides had grown tired of each other, though, with Nurse as the coach for Team Canada over the next two summers and the Raptors’ close ties to the program, they are still going to see quite a bit of each other. Could be some awkward, tense moments ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vogel won with James and the Lakers in his first season with a team that was built perfectly to his coaching style. The Lakers were long and rugged defensively. There was enough shooting around James, and Anthony Davis stayed healthy enough to anchor the Lakers’ stingy defense. Inexplicably, the Lakers made themselves smaller over Vogel’s next two seasons and paired James with Russell Westbrook — a disaster in the making — and Vogel was fired after last season when the Lakers didn’t make the playoffs. Never mind that James and Davis spent huge amounts of time in street clothes or that it was obvious Westbrook’s game didn’t fit with James.\n",
      "\n",
      "Budenholzer broke through with the Bucks in 2021 during a playoff run in which he was headed for a firing unless his team won it all. Milwaukee was bounced in the second round last season by the Celtics in a Game 7, while the Bucks didn’t have their second-best player, Khris Middleton, because of a knee injury. Megastar Giannis Antetokounmpo was out for two-and-a-half games of the Bucks’ first-round upset by the Heat this season, and Budenholzer’s brother died tragically during the series. After the series, Giannis gave that impassioned speech to the media about the perception of “failure” when a good team doesn’t win a title.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bucks, and for that matter, the Sixers, disagreed with Giannis’ take and fired their coaches as a result.\n",

      "GO DEEPER Milwaukee Bucks' championship changed expectations. The next head coach needs to meet them\n",
      "\n",
      "The NBA is down to three — count ’em — three untouchable coaches. They are Gregg Popovich in San Antonio (27 consecutive seasons and just landed Victor Wembanyama in the lottery), Erik Spoelstra in Miami (15 consecutive seasons) and Steve Kerr with Golden State (nine consecutive seasons).\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Popovich is the NBA’s all-time winningest coach, with 1,366 wins and five titles on top of that. He can coach the Spurs until he decides he wants to stop, and at age 74, with the Spurs in the middle of a rebuild, probably won’t win another championship. But there was seven years between San Antonio’s fourth and fifth titles under Pop, and during that time, there were two first-round exits. An organization with lesser stability or patience may have fired him after either of those losses and maybe the Spurs never win that 2014 championship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spoelstra has two championships with the Heat, but the three Eastern Conference finals appearances Miami has made since LeBron’s last finals there in 2014 are nothing short of remarkable. The Heat refused to rebuild when LeBron left, never tanked and missed the playoffs three times under Spoelstra anyway, but the patience of Miami’s ownership and front office, and unwavering belief in Spoelstra, has resulted in a 2020 finals berth, a near miss last year and a stunning trip to the conference finals that starts tonight in Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerr’s coaching career began with five consecutive finals and three titles. But after the Warriors lost the 2019 finals to Toronto, they followed up as the worst team in the league. Devastating injuries and some key departures of players (in Kevin Durant’s case, it was both) played a major role in that, but the bottom line is the Warriors went from first to worst in one season and didn’t consider canning Kerr. They stuck by him the following year too when the Warriors couldn’t get out of the Play-In Tournament and were rewarded by their faith in him. They won it all again last season.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only three markets in the NBA where any player who comes through knows that their ego, their will and their personal desires, will not be enough to topple a coach. KD and Draymond Green aren’t too big for Kerr, Jimmy Butler isn’t above Spoelstra in Miami and Leonard wasn’t more important than Pop in San Antonio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the league isn’t like that and look at the instability. Look at what happened in Brooklyn, where Kyrie Irving and Durant ran roughshod over an organization that was built to win titles. Consider Harden, who has forced his way out of Houston and Brooklyn, and now in Philadelphia, characterized his relationship with Rivers as just “OK” not long before Rivers was fired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about every market — Milwaukee, Cleveland, Memphis, New Orleans, Dallas — where organizations are terrified that their star player may grow unhappy and demand a trade before his contract is up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not a great way to run a business, and at least some of it is related to the relative weakness of the modern NBA head coach. They are typically the bosses in name only.\n",

      "The question\n",
      "\n",
      "I was recruited into a new role and quit my previous job to take the new one. Unfortunately, I was let go one month into a three-month probation period. Does this mean I’m not entitled to any severance or compensation? What are my options?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Shibil Siddiqi, partner, Progressive Barristers, Toronto\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ontario, employees terminated less than three months into their employment are not entitled to any notice or compensation under Ontario’s Employment Standards Act (ESA). However, probationary periods do not arise from legislation; they are established by the employment contract. Probationary periods longer than three months attract ESA protections. And in some circumstances, even shorter-term probationary employees may receive compensation under the common law or the Ontario Human Rights Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some employment contracts provide for set compensation upon termination. Most contain termination clauses that purport to restrict compensation to minimum ESA entitlements. Fortunately for employees, not all termination clauses are valid and enforceable. Termination clauses are void if they try to limit entitlements or rights under the ESA or if their meaning is ambiguous.\n",
      "\n",
      "A void termination clause entitles employees to common law reasonable notice (or pay in lieu thereof) upon termination. Such compensation is usually minimal for short-term employment. However, it can be more significant for employees in senior or highly specialized positions, or where employees have few other opportunities in the job market. Greater notice may also be provided where an employer used undue pressure tactics to induce an employee to quit a secure job to take up a new position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, regardless of the employment contract and ESA, an employee may be entitled to compensation if a ground protected by the Human Rights Code, such as race, gender or disability, was a factor in the termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interpretation of termination clauses can be a highly technical exercise and most employees can benefit from some legal advice on their options following termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Josh Hobbs, employment lawyer, Purnell Employment Law, Calgary\n",
      "\n",
      "You raise a valid concern. Given the three-month probation, and the fact you were terminated during that probation, you won’t be entitled to statutory severance. That’s because, in most provinces, employers are not required to pay statutory severance if they terminate an employee within 90 days. However, if a court were to find that the second employer induced you away from your previous job, then you may be entitled to common law severance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inducement is when an employer offers someone certain perks or promises to convince them to quit a secure, well-paying job and join their company. These can be things like a higher salary, better benefits or improved working conditions that aren’t normally offered to other employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a terminated employee can show that they wouldn’t have joined the company without these inducements, a court may award a greater amount of severance than what they would have otherwise received. The amount of this severance would depend on whether the previous job was secure and the extent of the employer’s efforts in attempting to recruit the individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you can establish that your employer had induced you to quit a secure, well-paying job, then you may be entitled to common law severance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to your options, we recommend discussing your situation in greater detail with an employment lawyer who specializes in working with employees. As the above explanation is only cursory, a consult is necessary in order to properly advise you of your rights and options.\n",

      "\n",
      "He said the last time the city of 21,000 experienced a wildfire threat to this magnitude was in 2016, when Fort St. John was on alert around the same time as the Fort McMurray fire that led to the evacuation of more than 90,000 people and destroyed 2,930 buildings.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Chapman said BC Wildfire Service is working with local governments on a plan in case Fort St. John’s evacuation alert is upgraded to an order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan Harvey, communications manager for the City of Fort St. John, said the plan includes where evacuees would go and how they would get there. He said the city hasn’t ever had to complete a full evacuation for all of its residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we’ve done is set up some controls in place that would allow for an evacuation order if required to come down early, so that so that if anything were to happen, it would give everybody enough time to leave the area,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lilia Hansen, the city’s mayor, said her community has a more “positive outlook” now compared with Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that there was a lot more people that, they could feel the stress from the smoke, the strong winds,” she said. “Fortunately, we have really excellent mapping data. We can see that the fires are quite a distance away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Chapman said there have been 206 fires in the province to date this year, compared with the 10-year average 162. The 10-year average of hectares burned is roughly 11,000, but this year, the province has seen upwards of around 50,000 hectares burned and likely more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said B.C. sent an incident management team, which is one of the six in the province that runs complex fires, to help with the fires in Alberta. This deployment, composed of about 20 people, will be returning this weekend, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the long weekend, Mr. Chapman noted that the province should see cooler, more seasonal temperatures as the high-pressure ridge breaks down.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he said that weather pattern can also trigger high winds and the potential for thunderstorms, with lightning that could ignite more fires.\n"

      "['David Wallace-Wells'] 2023-05-17 00:00:00 In Western Canada, fire season comes early by American standards — beginning, usually, right around now. In Alberta, by today’s date, only about 1,000 acres have burned in recent years. This season so far, the total is already more than 1.5 million — which would make it the province’s third-worst annual result, just a few weeks into May, with months more of wildfire season still to burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, by contrast, those who live in fear of wildfire are probably breathing a bit easier. Last year was a relatively light one, with fewer than eight million acres burning across the country — close to the two-decade average and well below the damage of several especially scarring recent seasons. This year looks potentially even milder, thanks to the onslaught of “atmospheric rivers” along the West Coast, which many Californians experienced as extreme weather whiplash but which also supercharged the state’s depleted snowpack, turned millions of drought-browned acres a verdant green and at least for a time managed to substitute the fear of flooding, in California’s quasi-apocalyptic ecological imagination, for fear of fire. For now there may be out-of-control blazes burning in Alberta, 2,000 miles away, but to most on the American side of the border, they are out of sight and out of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a new lesson from the evolving science of wildfire is about how far its toxic smoke spreads and how widely its noxious impacts are distributed. You may think of fire in terms of scorched homes and go bags sitting ready for sudden evacuation. But distance is no cordon sanitaire for smoke. In fact, according to one not-yet-published study led by Stanford researchers exploring the distribution of wildfire smoke, an estimated 60 percent of the smoke impact of American wildfire is experienced by those living outside the states where the trees are in flames. Eighty-seven percent of the impact is experienced by those living outside the county of the original fire. And the problem is getting much worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, a new generation of California fires have taught us their own new vocabulary: “gigafires,” for fires burning a million or more acres; “fire tornadoes,” for blazes burning intensely enough to create their own dramatic weather systems; the “pyrocene age,” for the current global era defined by fires. Perhaps more memorably, we are now haunted by a new visual vocabulary, too: a town called Paradise incinerated in hours, amber urban skyscapes and whole cities navigating darkness at noon, dashcam evacuations through walls of flame.\n"

      "['Joe Vardon'] 2023-05-17 00:00:00 Within 24 hours of losing his job in Los Angeles nearly three years ago, Doc Rivers was on a flight to Philadelphia to interview for his next one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivers leapfrogged one of his assistants and chief protégé Tyronn Lue to become the next coach of the 76ers because Sixers star Joel Embiid preferred how Rivers intended to use Embiid in the offense. Embiid also was leery of Lue’s perceived ties to Ben Simmons through his closeness to Rich Paul and Klutch Sports — who at the time was managing Simmons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, none of these items are news. The neck-snapping speed with which Rivers became a candidate in Philadelphia after he and the Clippers said goodbye was immediately obvious. And I’d previously reported the Embiid-Rivers, Lue-Simmons angle on the eve of Rivers’ first season with the Sixers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think the history of how Rivers got the job in Philadelphia, what transpired over his three seasons there and that he’s out of a job now — while three other marquee coaches who have all been fired within the last month or so are prime candidates to replace him — are all excellent examples of the absurdity with which most of organizations treat the head-coaching position in the modern NBA.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the NBA’s owners want to wrestle away some of the enormous power the players hold over teams, they would do well to reset the nonsensical coaching carousel that has spun out of control to the point where Rivers, Monty Williams, Mike Budenholzer and Nick Nurse could end up replacing one another before the summer even begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hours after Rivers’ firing was announced I spoke with three NBA front-office executives — two in the Western Conference and one in the Eastern Conference — who expressed somewhere between skepticism and outright doubt that Rivers would get another job for the upcoming season. But then one pointed to the unpredictability of the situation in Phoenix, where new owner Mat Ishbia has traded for Kevin Durant and fired Williams, and another mentioned Rivers as a potential sleeper candidate in Milwaukee, and around we go again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s first close the loop on Rivers’ time with the Sixers.\n",
      "\n",
      "GO DEEPER For Doc Rivers and others, being an NBA coach has never been easy\n",
      "\n",
      "Embiid, who for the sake of argument here favored Rivers, proceeded to enjoy the best three seasons of his NBA career. He was statistically and aesthetically dominant enough in those three campaigns to be runner-up for MVP twice and then finally won the award this season with back-to-back league-scoring titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, the Sixers lost in the conference semifinals in each season. In 2021, they dropped a Game 7 to the Atlanta Hawks. Simmons refused to shoot the ball in the fourth quarter and never played another game for the Sixers. In 2022, James Harden’s first with Rivers, the Sixers were beaten in six games by the Miami Heat. Embiid battled through a broken thumb, and Harden refused to take a shot in the second half of the deciding game.\n",
      "\n",
      "And because it just happened, we all remember the Sixers’ 2023 flameout, coughing up a 3-2 series lead to the Celtics and getting blown out in Game 7, with Harden and Embiid playing terribly in the series decider.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sixers fired Rivers after losing two Game 7s in his three seasons. He is 6-10 in his career in such games, and the 10 Game 7 defeats are easily the most in NBA history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we pass judgment on Rivers in Philadelphia, let’s take a peek at how his old team has done since he and the Clippers “mutually part(ed) ways,” as it was deemed by the team in 2020. Rivers was not coming back after blowing a 3-1 series lead in the second round to Denver that season in the NBA bubble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Lue, the Clippers broke through to the Western Conference finals in 2021, failed to make the playoffs in 2022 and were out in the first round this season. Kawhi Leonard tore up his knee in the ’21 Western semis, didn’t play at all the following season and appeared in precisely two playoff games this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe Lue is one of the best coaches in the league and I should note we maintain a close working relationship. But if we’re being fair to all coaches who get fired because they don’t reach the finals, on average, the Clippers haven’t done much better with Ty than they did with Doc. And the Sixers, on average, have gone deeper in the playoffs the last three seasons than the Clippers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Being fired is part of the job as a coach of a professional sports franchise, especially in the NBA. Of the last five coaches to win the finals, four have since been fired. They are Lue (won in 2016, fired in fall of ’18), Nurse (won in 2019, fired in April), Frank Vogel (won in 2020, fired in ’22) and Budenholzer (won in 2021, fired last week).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lue steered Cleveland to three consecutive finals. LeBron James left for the Lakers in the summer of 2018, and after an 0-6 start the following season, the Cavs fired Lue. To this day, Lue and I disagree with each other over whether the firing was prudent. I contend he’d openly defied his superiors in protest over the Cavs shifting into a rebuild when they said they weren’t doing that. Fair or not, it was grounds for firing. Lue still contends he didn’t deserve it because of all he’d done for the franchise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nurse, after his title, was thrust into as difficult a situation as any championship coach. He lost his star player — Leonard — immediately, and then, after the 2020 NBA bubble season, had to coach the entirety of the following season on the road because Canada’s COVID-19 pandemic rules essentially prohibited the Raptors from playing home games. This was the second time since 2021 the Raptors failed to make the playoffs under Nurse, and it seemed like both sides had grown tired of each other, though, with Nurse as the coach for Team Canada over the next two summers and the Raptors’ close ties to the program, they are still going to see quite a bit of each other. Could be some awkward, tense moments ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vogel won with James and the Lakers in his first season with a team that was built perfectly to his coaching style. The Lakers were long and rugged defensively. There was enough shooting around James, and Anthony Davis stayed healthy enough to anchor the Lakers’ stingy defense. Inexplicably, the Lakers made themselves smaller over Vogel’s next two seasons and paired James with Russell Westbrook — a disaster in the making — and Vogel was fired after last season when the Lakers didn’t make the playoffs. Never mind that James and Davis spent huge amounts of time in street clothes or that it was obvious Westbrook’s game didn’t fit with James.\n",
      "\n",
      "Budenholzer broke through with the Bucks in 2021 during a playoff run in which he was headed for a firing unless his team won it all. Milwaukee was bounced in the second round last season by the Celtics in a Game 7, while the Bucks didn’t have their second-best player, Khris Middleton, because of a knee injury. Megastar Giannis Antetokounmpo was out for two-and-a-half games of the Bucks’ first-round upset by the Heat this season, and Budenholzer’s brother died tragically during the series. After the series, Giannis gave that impassioned speech to the media about the perception of “failure” when a good team doesn’t win a title.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bucks, and for that matter, the Sixers, disagreed with Giannis’ take and fired their coaches as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "GO DEEPER Milwaukee Bucks' championship changed expectations. The next head coach needs to meet them\n",
      "\n",
      "The NBA is down to three — count ’em — three untouchable coaches. They are Gregg Popovich in San Antonio (27 consecutive seasons and just landed Victor Wembanyama in the lottery), Erik Spoelstra in Miami (15 consecutive seasons) and Steve Kerr with Golden State (nine consecutive seasons).\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Popovich is the NBA’s all-time winningest coach, with 1,366 wins and five titles on top of that. He can coach the Spurs until he decides he wants to stop, and at age 74, with the Spurs in the middle of a rebuild, probably won’t win another championship. But there was seven years between San Antonio’s fourth and fifth titles under Pop, and during that time, there were two first-round exits. An organization with lesser stability or patience may have fired him after either of those losses and maybe the Spurs never win that 2014 championship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spoelstra has two championships with the Heat, but the three Eastern Conference finals appearances Miami has made since LeBron’s last finals there in 2014 are nothing short of remarkable. The Heat refused to rebuild when LeBron left, never tanked and missed the playoffs three times under Spoelstra anyway, but the patience of Miami’s ownership and front office, and unwavering belief in Spoelstra, has resulted in a 2020 finals berth, a near miss last year and a stunning trip to the conference finals that starts tonight in Boston.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerr’s coaching career began with five consecutive finals and three titles. But after the Warriors lost the 2019 finals to Toronto, they followed up as the worst team in the league. Devastating injuries and some key departures of players (in Kevin Durant’s case, it was both) played a major role in that, but the bottom line is the Warriors went from first to worst in one season and didn’t consider canning Kerr. They stuck by him the following year too when the Warriors couldn’t get out of the Play-In Tournament and were rewarded by their faith in him. They won it all again last season.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only three markets in the NBA where any player who comes through knows that their ego, their will and their personal desires, will not be enough to topple a coach. KD and Draymond Green aren’t too big for Kerr, Jimmy Butler isn’t above Spoelstra in Miami and Leonard wasn’t more important than Pop in San Antonio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the league isn’t like that and look at the instability. Look at what happened in Brooklyn, where Kyrie Irving and Durant ran roughshod over an organization that was built to win titles. Consider Harden, who has forced his way out of Houston and Brooklyn, and now in Philadelphia, characterized his relationship with Rivers as just “OK” not long before Rivers was fired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about every market — Milwaukee, Cleveland, Memphis, New Orleans, Dallas — where organizations are terrified that their star player may grow unhappy and demand a trade before his contract is up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not a great way to run a business, and at least some of it is related to the relative weakness of the modern NBA head coach. They are typically the bosses in name only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe this won’t happen, but by the end of the month, we could have a scenario where Williams replaces Budenholzer in Milwaukee, Bud takes over for Rivers in Philadelphia, or Nurse does, and Rivers or Nurse becomes the next coach in Phoenix. Or something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all four of these coaches, after immediately being fired from their old jobs, are instantly qualified to take over other teams with star players and championship aspirations, how can we truly argue, with a straight face, that they were no longer qualified for the jobs they had?\n",
      "\n",
      "In a vacuum, you or I could make a case for Rivers being run out of Philadelphia. Or we could blame Harden or Embiid.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Rivers’ firing is emblematic of a deeper problem in the NBA, where coaches get fired all the time, players grow more and more powerful because of it and too often wield that power to disrupt any chance at stability these franchises had to begin with.\n",

      "Those planning to be outdoors in affected areas this long weekend should first check their local air quality rating and “plan the activities accordingly,” said Environment Canada meteorologist Carmen Hartt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even healthy people should try to stay indoors while smoke particles affect air quality, Chee said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The concern is that these particles in the air can go deep into your lungs and they can irritate the lungs,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“(They) can cause inflammation not only in the lungs themselves, but can actually cause some stress in your heart too, because inflammation can affect the heart.”\n",

      "The reason smoke is visible while viruses aren’t, she said, is due to the sheer volume of smoke particles.\n",

      "['Drake Bentley'] 2023-05-19 00:00:00 Wisconsin teacher who spoke out about 'Rainbowland' ban says she is being terminated\n",
      "\n",
      "First grade teacher Melissa Tempel, who spoke out about the decision of Waukesha Schools in Wisconsin to ban \"Rainbowland\" by Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton from a spring concert, said the district's superintendent has recommended she be terminated from her job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tempel said she was informed on Monday by superintendent James Sebert. In an email, Sebert told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a member of the USA TODAY Network, on Wednesday that he was unable to comment on the personnel matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommendation is in the wake of the school's decision to ban \"Rainbowland,\" which has caught the attention of national media outlets, a Cyrus' nonprofit, and even former President Barack Obama, who followed Tempel on Twitter shortly after she spoke out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tempel is currently on leave from the district after being placed on leave on April 3. At the time, Sebert referred the Journal Sentinel to an assistant superintendent responsible for human resources, who declined to comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sebert's recommendation would require approval from the Waukesha School Board. The Journal Sentinel contacted Kelly Piacsek, the school board's president, but did not immediately get a response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, Wisconsin state school superintendent Jill Underly sent a letter to Sebert and the school board saying she was \"deeply troubled by the harm caused\" by the district's decision to ban the song, and that the district should reverse course on its decision to enforce its Controversial Issues in the Classroom policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The policy, according to a letter Sebert sent in 2021, bans the use of Pride, Black Lives Matter, Thin Blue Line and \"any other posters or materials to the such\" from classrooms. Sebert said the decision to ban the song was because it violated the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sebert also said in March the decision to pull the song was based on \"whether it was appropriate for the age and maturity level of the students\" and because of \"social or personal impacts\" on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underly, in her letter, stated, \"Whether you realize it or not, you are, under the guise of protection, causing undue harm to students and staff. However, this damage is reversible. It is paramount that you change course now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The decisions you have made as district leaders have intensified the stressors our teachers feel and helped create and continue to perpetuate a toxic environment,\" she wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underly's letter led to a response from Sebert and state Republican lawmakers who said Underly needs to be mindful of local control.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a former School Superintendent yourself, you know how critically important local control is for Boards and administrators to meet the varied needs in their communities,\" Sebert wrote back to Underly. \"As the State Superintendent, you likely realize that with over 400 school districts in Wisconsin, one size does not fit all on any given topic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Four Waukesha County state legislators — Rep. Scott Allen, Rep. Adam Neylon, Sen. Chris Kapenga and Sen. Rob Hutton — sent a letter to Underly as well, saying they were \"proud\" of the school district and its actions. \"Your letter also undermines local control,\" the lawmakers added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wisconsin teacher says removing her from the classroom has been 'traumatic' for her students\n",
      "\n",
      "Tempel said a district administrator told her she should not speak with other staff, students, parents or members of the public about her leave, but when she found out on Monday that she was recommended to be terminated from her job she decided to release a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tempel released the statement through the Alliance for Education in Waukesha, Wisconsin, a group of parents who in April said they are seeking a state Department of Justice investigation into Sebert, accusing him of discrimination of LGBTQ+ students and staff following a series policy changes and actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin James Santelle said in April that he advised the alliance and suggested filing a federal civil rights lawsuit against the administration, saying district policies violate the First Amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her statement, Tempel said removing her from the classroom had a \"harmful\" and \"traumatic\" impact on the students at Heyer Elementary School.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My students’ parents, many of whom speak Spanish, did not receive any information about my absence or when I would return, even when they asked for it directly,\" Tempel wrote. \"As recently as last week some of them didn’t know that I was placed on administrative leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is not normal procedure during a teacher’s absence and doesn’t prioritize the emotional or academic well being of my students. ... It will take me a long time to process how cruel the District’s actions were to those families and the chilling effect my termination will have on any other educators in the Waukesha Community.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tempel said she has been a teacher for 23 years. \"I have been consistently held up as a model educator,\" she wrote. \"I am an award winning, National Board Certified Teacher who was rated 'distinguished educator' by my administrators for three years in a row. Last year, I was named Outstanding Educator by Wisconsin Badgers Athletics and WEAC. I have never had disciplinary action taken against me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remain committed to the work I have done throughout my life and career, both inside and outside the classroom, as an activist, advocate, and ally. I believe we need to have conversations in our communities about how to make sure our schools are inclusive spaces where our students feel safe and can focus on learning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tempel said she will be pursuing a \"First Amendment claim,\" but it's unclear if that will be a federal lawsuit.\n"

      "\n",
      "Unprecedented? Where were they in 2017, when British Columbia had its worst fire season on record and generated four simultaneous pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms? Where were they in 2016, when Fort McMurray burned – for days – along with 6,000 square kilometres of forest? What about 2011, when Slave Lake lost its town hall, library, radio station and 500 houses in a few hours?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, the current fire situation is not unprecedented, and calling it the “new normal” is offensive. There’s nothing “normal” about it. Do I sound angry? I have a right to be, and so do you. In the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists predicted that the effects of increased industrial CO2 would penetrate the “noise” of random climate fluctuations and become measurable in the form of rising global temperatures, especially at higher latitudes like ours.\n",

      "Brown smoke envelops Fort McMurray in 2016, as seen from the ground on May 6 and from NASA’s Aqua satellite on May 9. Jason Franson/The Canadian Press; NASA via Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "I started working on my latest book, Fire Weather, in 2016, just days after Fort McMurray disappeared beneath a fire-borne pyrocumulus cloud 14 kilometres tall. I did so not because this was a once-in-a-lifetime fire (the intervening years have proven otherwise). I did it because I understood, way back in 2016, that if a fire could do that much damage to such a wealthy, well-equipped subarctic city when the lakes were still frozen and car-sized blocks of ice still lined the Athabasca River, imagine what it could do to more southerly towns filled with old, densely packed wooden houses? Places such as Vancouver, Moose Jaw or St. John’s? Imagine what such a fire could do in cottage country, or in the thousands of rural communities located in the wildland urban interface, where half of Canadians, and a third of Americans, now live.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was scared, but I’m also angry: This situation was foreseen more than half a century ago, and it is now upon us with a vengeance. Wildfire seasons have been lengthening, and fires have been burning with a greater destructive intensity. I call it “21st-century fire” because that’s when fire really started to get weird. Before 2000, wildfire-generated pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms were an extreme rarity. Now they are a common feature; Alberta generated several of them in the first week of May alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, and elsewhere, wildfires have traditionally been viewed as a rural problem. But as we’ve seen in recent years in Australia, the United States, Canada – and many other places – cities and towns are increasingly under threat. The area of greatest concern to Canadians is the wildland urban interface – a.k.a. the WUI (rhymes with “phooey”). The WUI is where the forest meets the built environment, i.e., those tree-lined subdivisions where so many new Canadian homes are being built. It’s a beautiful place to live, until it’s on fire. The bad news is: Whether you live in the suburbs of Victoria, Saskatoon or Calgary, your neighbourhood is more flammable than it used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what else is different about 21st-century fire: In Fort McMurray on May 3, 2016, the temperature broke the record high for that date by 6 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity plummeted to 12 per cent – drier than Death Valley. For fire, that’s as good as gasoline. The Fort McMurray fire grew so big, so fast, it overran the city in an afternoon and generated its own stratospheric storm system in the middle of what had been a bluebird Alberta day. As the city’s residents made their frantic escape, it was through apocalyptic conditions that recalled the seventh plague in the Bible’s Book of Exodus: “So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land since Egypt became a nation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was none like it since Canada became a nation, either: The exodus of May 3 was the largest, most rapid displacement of people because of fire in modern times – anywhere on Earth. So profound was the damage, and so persistent were the flames (houses and work camps were still burning down two weeks later) that the city was closed for a full month. With the sole exception of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, no other North American city has been disinhabited for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few human beings alive have experienced what tens of thousands of our fellow citizens suddenly found themselves in the middle of on that blistering spring day. It was terrifying, and, as many survivors of the fire told me, hard to believe. Some things are just too big to fit in your head, and the Fort McMurray fire was one of those things. For some, it still is. A week into the fire, then-premier Rachel Notley tried to articulate the devastation she saw: “You go to a place where there was a house and what do you see on the ground? Nails. Piles and piles of nails.”\n",

In this historical moment, fire is what drives us, what empowers us, what enables and enriches us, and it raises a burning question: Who is empowering whom? Fires are now burning where they’ve never burned before: Greenland, the High Arctic, and in rainforests from B.C. to Brazil. In 2021, even the International Energy Agency – historically, a friend to the fossil-fuel industry – said: Enough! If we are to maintain any semblance of climate stability, we must stop building fossil-fuel projects right now.\n",

With our cars and stoves and central heating, hundreds of millions of us now live like emperors of old – only instead of enslaved people and draft animals serving us, we have fire-powered machines. Most Canadians command a vast invisible retinue. Just imagine how many horses it would take to move a two-ton minivan from Toronto to Ottawa at highway speed. Thanks to superb engineering, we remain blissfully unaware of the violent explosions taking place under the minivan’s hood with every turn of the crankshaft.

      "Billions of us are engaged in these activities. Lightning strikes the Earth millions of times a day, starting thousands of fires, but lightning’s got nothing on us. For starters, about three billion people are still cooking and heating with open fires. Meanwhile, in the developed world, you’ve got hundreds of millions of gas stoves, water heaters and home furnaces. The list of flammables goes on: Wars and trash generate a lot of fires; so does slash-and-burn agriculture, so do forest fires, and so does petroleum refining. According to the National Energy Board, Alberta’s bitumen industry uses more than 57,000,000 cubic metres (two billion cubic feet) of natural gas per day – the energy equivalent of 350,000 barrels of oil – for the sole purpose of separating bitumen from sand. Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas in the world; in 2017, nearly a third of Canada’s total production was devoted to processing bitumen. Even after this colossal energy input, the rendered bitumen will still need further, fire-intensive upgrading to be actually burnable. Lest there be any confusion, natural gas is about 80 per cent methane, a greenhouse gas 50 times more potent than CO2.\n",

      "Already, we’re into the billions of daily human-caused fires, but it’s when I started looking at engines that the numbers really took off. Globally, you’ve got well over a billion cars, a quarter-billion trucks, 200 million motorcycles, 25,000 passenger jets, and 50,000 ocean-going freighters (a third of which are devoted to transporting more fuel to burn). A single six-cylinder minivan running at driving-to-school speed – 2,500 RPM – will generate around 10,000 combustions a minute, more than half a million per hour. That’s a lot of fires. Add them all up and you get tens of trillions of individual combustions. That, roughly speaking, is the number of fires humans make every day – uncountable as stars in the universe.\n",

A certain amount is absorbed into limestone by chemical weathering, but the bulk of anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2 is absorbed by our oceans, or set loose in our atmosphere where it remains active for decades, if not centuries. Findings published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters revealed that, over the past 40 years, roughly 40 per cent of the area burned in wildfires in the western U.S. and southwestern Canada can be traced to industrial CO2 emissions.\n",

Atmospheric CO2 levels are now fully 50 per cent higher than preindustrial times, and it affects everything we care about, from fetuses to phytoplankton, from water to winter. “Fire weather” is not just a book title, it’s a technical term. Natural Resources Canada uses a Fire Weather Index to gauge fire risk, and when the index is high, things we care about and depend on ignite much more easily. When Fort McMurray burned, the Fire Weather Index peaked at 42 – record territory, well beyond “Extreme.” In B.C., during the heat dome of 2021, it went far higher. Now, that was “unprecedented.”\n",

I did so not because this was a once-in-a-lifetime fire (the intervening years have proven otherwise). I did it because I understood, way back in 2016, that if a fire could do that much damage to such a wealthy, well-equipped subarctic city when the lakes were still frozen and car-sized blocks of ice still lined the Athabasca River, imagine what it could do to more southerly towns filled with old, densely packed wooden houses? Places such as Vancouver, Moose Jaw or St. John’s? Imagine what such a fire could do in cottage country, or in the thousands of rural communities located in the wildland urban interface, where half of Canadians, and a third of Americans, now live.\n",

      "I was scared, but I’m also angry: This situation was foreseen more than half a century ago, and it is now upon us with a vengeance. Wildfire seasons have been lengthening, and fires have been burning with a greater destructive intensity. I call it “21st-century fire” because that’s when fire really started to get weird. Before 2000, wildfire-generated pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms were an extreme rarity. Now they are a common feature; Alberta generated several of them in the first week of May alone.\n",

      "In Canada, and elsewhere, wildfires have traditionally been viewed as a rural problem. But as we’ve seen in recent years in Australia, the United States, Canada – and many other places – cities and towns are increasingly under threat. The area of greatest concern to Canadians is the wildland urban interface – a.k.a. the WUI (rhymes with “phooey”). The WUI is where the forest meets the built environment, i.e., those tree-lined subdivisions where so many new Canadian homes are being built. It’s a beautiful place to live, until it’s on fire. The bad news is: Whether you live in the suburbs of Victoria, Saskatoon or Calgary, your neighbourhood is more flammable than it used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what else is different about 21st-century fire: In Fort McMurray on May 3, 2016, the temperature broke the record high for that date by 6 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity plummeted to 12 per cent – drier than Death Valley. For fire, that’s as good as gasoline. The Fort McMurray fire grew so big, so fast, it overran the city in an afternoon and generated its own stratospheric storm system in the middle of what had been a bluebird Alberta day. As the city’s residents made their frantic escape, it was through apocalyptic conditions that recalled the seventh plague in the Bible’s Book of Exodus: “So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land since Egypt became a nation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was none like it since Canada became a nation, either: The exodus of May 3 was the largest, most rapid displacement of people because of fire in modern times – anywhere on Earth. So profound was the damage, and so persistent were the flames (houses and work camps were still burning down two weeks later) that the city was closed for a full month. With the sole exception of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, no other North American city has been disinhabited for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few human beings alive have experienced what tens of thousands of our fellow citizens suddenly found themselves in the middle of on that blistering spring day. It was terrifying, and, as many survivors of the fire told me, hard to believe. Some things are just too big to fit in your head, and the Fort McMurray fire was one of those things. For some, it still is. A week into the fire, then-premier Rachel Notley tried to articulate the devastation she saw: “You go to a place where there was a house and what do you see on the ground? Nails. Piles and piles of nails.”\n",

Atmospheric CO2 levels are now fully 50 per cent higher than preindustrial times, and it affects everything we care about, from fetuses to phytoplankton, from water to winter. “Fire weather” is not just a book title, it’s a technical term. Natural Resources Canada uses a Fire Weather Index to gauge fire risk, and when the index is high, things we care about and depend on ignite much more easily. When Fort McMurray burned, the Fire Weather Index peaked at 42 – record territory, well beyond “Extreme.” In B.C., during the heat dome of 2021, it went far higher. Now, that was “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not unique to Canada; weather services around the world are scrambling to find new names and colours to account for these off-the-charts extremes in temperature, flammability, rainfall, ocean surge – you name it. It’s like the Spinal Tap amp that goes up to 11, only not funny: Australia’s new Fire Danger Ratings System goes from High to Extreme to Catastrophic.\n",

Meanwhile, the town of Lytton, B.C., broke national temperature records three days running, topping out at a brain-boiling 50 C. The following day, a wind-driven wildfire, started by sparks from a passing freight train, burned Lytton to the ground in half an hour. More than 500 buildings were destroyed; two people died. “I’m 60,” said Lytton’s then-mayor, Jan Polderman, “and I thought climate change was a problem for the next generation.

Under his leadership, Canopy grew into a company valued at around $18-billion. Bruce, in many ways, became the face of the cannabis boom. But things ended badly between Bruce and the company he created. Cannabis sales failed to meet the hype and in 2019, he was fired by the board. So what led to one of the most public business failures in recent memory?

      "['John Vaillant'] 2023-05-19 09:00:00-04:00 John Vaillant’s latest book is Fire Weather: The Making of a Beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "We weren’t a week into May before 30,000 people had been evacuated because of dozens of fast-moving wildfires in Alberta. Structure losses were mounting, and politicians were trotting out words like “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unprecedented? Where were they in 2017, when British Columbia had its worst fire season on record and generated four simultaneous pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms? Where were they in 2016, when Fort McMurray burned – for days – along with 6,000 square kilometres of forest? What about 2011, when Slave Lake lost its town hall, library, radio station and 500 houses in a few hours?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, the current fire situation is not unprecedented, and calling it the “new normal” is offensive. There’s nothing “normal” about it. Do I sound angry? I have a right to be, and so do you. In the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists predicted that the effects of increased industrial CO2 would penetrate the “noise” of random climate fluctuations and become measurable in the form of rising global temperatures, especially at higher latitudes like ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown smoke envelops Fort McMurray in 2016, as seen from the ground on May 6 and from NASA’s Aqua satellite on May 9. Jason Franson/The Canadian Press; NASA via Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "I started working on my latest book, Fire Weather, in 2016, just days after Fort McMurray disappeared beneath a fire-borne pyrocumulus cloud 14 kilometres tall. I did so not because this was a once-in-a-lifetime fire (the intervening years have proven otherwise). I did it because I understood, way back in 2016, that if a fire could do that much damage to such a wealthy, well-equipped subarctic city when the lakes were still frozen and car-sized blocks of ice still lined the Athabasca River, imagine what it could do to more southerly towns filled with old, densely packed wooden houses? Places such as Vancouver, Moose Jaw or St. John’s? Imagine what such a fire could do in cottage country, or in the thousands of rural communities located in the wildland urban interface, where half of Canadians, and a third of Americans, now live.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was scared, but I’m also angry: This situation was foreseen more than half a century ago, and it is now upon us with a vengeance. Wildfire seasons have been lengthening, and fires have been burning with a greater destructive intensity. I call it “21st-century fire” because that’s when fire really started to get weird. Before 2000, wildfire-generated pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms were an extreme rarity. Now they are a common feature; Alberta generated several of them in the first week of May alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, and elsewhere, wildfires have traditionally been viewed as a rural problem. But as we’ve seen in recent years in Australia, the United States, Canada – and many other places – cities and towns are increasingly under threat. The area of greatest concern to Canadians is the wildland urban interface – a.k.a. the WUI (rhymes with “phooey”). The WUI is where the forest meets the built environment, i.e., those tree-lined subdivisions where so many new Canadian homes are being built. It’s a beautiful place to live, until it’s on fire. The bad news is: Whether you live in the suburbs of Victoria, Saskatoon or Calgary, your neighbourhood is more flammable than it used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what else is different about 21st-century fire: In Fort McMurray on May 3, 2016, the temperature broke the record high for that date by 6 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity plummeted to 12 per cent – drier than Death Valley. For fire, that’s as good as gasoline. The Fort McMurray fire grew so big, so fast, it overran the city in an afternoon and generated its own stratospheric storm system in the middle of what had been a bluebird Alberta day. As the city’s residents made their frantic escape, it was through apocalyptic conditions that recalled the seventh plague in the Bible’s Book of Exodus: “So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land since Egypt became a nation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was none like it since Canada became a nation, either: The exodus of May 3 was the largest, most rapid displacement of people because of fire in modern times – anywhere on Earth. So profound was the damage, and so persistent were the flames (houses and work camps were still burning down two weeks later) that the city was closed for a full month. With the sole exception of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, no other North American city has been disinhabited for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few human beings alive have experienced what tens of thousands of our fellow citizens suddenly found themselves in the middle of on that blistering spring day. It was terrifying, and, as many survivors of the fire told me, hard to believe. Some things are just too big to fit in your head, and the Fort McMurray fire was one of those things. For some, it still is. A week into the fire, then-premier Rachel Notley tried to articulate the devastation she saw: “You go to a place where there was a house and what do you see on the ground? Nails. Piles and piles of nails.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fort McMurray homes lie in ruins on May 13, 2016, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took a tour of the damage. A year later, MacEwan University researchers estimated the overall cost of the disaster at more than $8.86-billion. Jason Franson/Reuters\n",

      "In ancient times, the only things that could manifest this kind of annihilating End-Times energy were volcanoes, earthquakes and angry gods. Now, after two hundred years of relentless combustion, our fossil-fuel-driven civilization has become its own volcano.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I mean by that?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easier to wrap your head around the impact of a fire-powered civilization when you get past euphemisms such as “fossil fuels,” “coal” and “oil and gas,” and call our prime mover by its true name: fire. In this historical moment, fire is what drives us, what empowers us, what enables and enriches us, and it raises a burning question: Who is empowering whom? Fires are now burning where they’ve never burned before: Greenland, the High Arctic, and in rainforests from B.C. to Brazil. In 2021, even the International Energy Agency – historically, a friend to the fossil-fuel industry – said: Enough! If we are to maintain any semblance of climate stability, we must stop building fossil-fuel projects right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the IEA is freaked out, you know we’ve turned a corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire, and our slavish devotion to its force-multiplying power, lies at the root of our current situation. With our cars and stoves and central heating, hundreds of millions of us now live like emperors of old – only instead of enslaved people and draft animals serving us, we have fire-powered machines. Most Canadians command a vast invisible retinue. Just imagine how many horses it would take to move a two-ton minivan from Toronto to Ottawa at highway speed. Thanks to superb engineering, we remain blissfully unaware of the violent explosions taking place under the minivan’s hood with every turn of the crankshaft. Thanks to disingenuous advertising and lax laws, we are equally oblivious to the 100 kilograms of CO2 trailing behind us on that single Toronto-to-Ottawa run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billions of us are engaged in these activities. Lightning strikes the Earth millions of times a day, starting thousands of fires, but lightning’s got nothing on us. For starters, about three billion people are still cooking and heating with open fires. Meanwhile, in the developed world, you’ve got hundreds of millions of gas stoves, water heaters and home furnaces. The list of flammables goes on: Wars and trash generate a lot of fires; so does slash-and-burn agriculture, so do forest fires, and so does petroleum refining. According to the National Energy Board, Alberta’s bitumen industry uses more than 57,000,000 cubic metres (two billion cubic feet) of natural gas per day – the energy equivalent of 350,000 barrels of oil – for the sole purpose of separating bitumen from sand. Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas in the world; in 2017, nearly a third of Canada’s total production was devoted to processing bitumen. Even after this colossal energy input, the rendered bitumen will still need further, fire-intensive upgrading to be actually burnable. Lest there be any confusion, natural gas is about 80 per cent methane, a greenhouse gas 50 times more potent than CO2.\n",

      "\n",
      "Already, we’re into the billions of daily human-caused fires, but it’s when I started looking at engines that the numbers really took off. Globally, you’ve got well over a billion cars, a quarter-billion trucks, 200 million motorcycles, 25,000 passenger jets, and 50,000 ocean-going freighters (a third of which are devoted to transporting more fuel to burn). A single six-cylinder minivan running at driving-to-school speed – 2,500 RPM – will generate around 10,000 combustions a minute, more than half a million per hour. That’s a lot of fires. Add them all up and you get tens of trillions of individual combustions. That, roughly speaking, is the number of fires humans make every day – uncountable as stars in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Nature: “Behold my mighty volcanoes and wildfires!” Humans: “Hold my beer.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Every single one of those fires generates CO2 emissions, and all of it stays here on Earth (no, carbon capture will not make a dent in this). A certain amount is absorbed into limestone by chemical weathering, but the bulk of anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2 is absorbed by our oceans, or set loose in our atmosphere where it remains active for decades, if not centuries. Findings published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters revealed that, over the past 40 years, roughly 40 per cent of the area burned in wildfires in the western U.S. and southwestern Canada can be traced to industrial CO2 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: When you extract, upgrade, refine and burn toxic substances such as coal, bitumen, oil and gas at the rate we are burning them, decade after decade, you’re going to see changes. Atmospheric CO2 levels are now fully 50 per cent higher than preindustrial times, and it affects everything we care about, from fetuses to phytoplankton, from water to winter. “Fire weather” is not just a book title, it’s a technical term. Natural Resources Canada uses a Fire Weather Index to gauge fire risk, and when the index is high, things we care about and depend on ignite much more easily. When Fort McMurray burned, the Fire Weather Index peaked at 42 – record territory, well beyond “Extreme.” In B.C., during the heat dome of 2021, it went far higher. Now, that was “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not unique to Canada; weather services around the world are scrambling to find new names and colours to account for these off-the-charts extremes in temperature, flammability, rainfall, ocean surge – you name it. It’s like the Spinal Tap amp that goes up to 11, only not funny: Australia’s new Fire Danger Ratings System goes from High to Extreme to Catastrophic.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is fire weather for a new planet. A planet we have made.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this new, more combustible world that industrialized nations have imposed on all of us, Canada has a role to play, and culpability to own. These are challenging subjects for a major energy-producing (that is, fire-producing) country like ours. But if we are strong enough, and brave enough, to get 88,000 people out of a burning city – and then save that city – without losing a single person to the flames, then surely we can do difficult things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, we can talk about how Canada’s emissions have continued to rise while those of other G7 countries have been falling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, we can talk about why Canada’s per capita emissions still vie for the highest in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely we can acknowledge that our own petroleum companies and many elected officials have been working overtime to delay progress on a safe, smooth transition away from fossil fuels. (If you want to know how hard Suncor, Imperial and their enablers have worked to subvert these efforts, read Geoff Dembicki’s damning exposé, The Petroleum Papers.)\n",
      "\n",
      "We must reduce our emissions ASAP if we are to minimize the already lethal havoc climate change is wreaking – right now – on our beautiful country and our beloved people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because here’s what happens if we don’t: During the western heat dome of June, 2021, more than 600 people were killed by the heat, making it the deadliest weather event in Canadian history. Meanwhile, the town of Lytton, B.C., broke national temperature records three days running, topping out at a brain-boiling 50 C. The following day, a wind-driven wildfire, started by sparks from a passing freight train, burned Lytton to the ground in half an hour. More than 500 buildings were destroyed; two people died. “I’m 60,” said Lytton’s then-mayor, Jan Polderman, “and I thought climate change was a problem for the next generation. Now, I’m mayor of a town that no longer exists.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The future is here, and too many Canadians have experienced the damage these homegrown fires cause. I have stood with survivors in the ash and ruin of their lives, and trust me, you wouldn’t wish this terror and sorrow on anyone. But I’ve seen the Fire Weather Index and this week, this month, this summer, that number is sure to grow.\n",

      "The federal government is proposing to advance up to $40-million in new funding for Ontario’s Ring of Fire, in an effort to boost development in one of the highest profile critical-minerals projects in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, in a May 17 letter to George Pirie, Ontario’s Minister of Mines, said that Ottawa is prepared to advance the funds to help the province and First Nations conduct feasibility and sustainability initiatives, economic analysis and other predevelopment work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pirie wrote in an e-mail to The Globe that Ontario, through its pledge to fund $1-billion in costs for a proposed road into the Ring of Fire and other related infrastructure, is already exceeding the federal government’s financial commitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Located 550 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, the undeveloped Ring of Fire region has been touted by Ontario Premier Doug Ford as an essential piece of the province’s plan to become a global player in battery metals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past few years, the Ring of Fire has taken on added importance as the Canadian and U.S. governments have vowed to build up North American supplies of critical minerals in an effort to challenge China’s dominance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wilkinson, in the letter to Mr. Pirie, also proposed setting up a working group between various federal government ministers and their Ontario counterparts to “formalize and advance dialogues on the feasibility and sustainability of opportunities” in the Ring of Fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I recognize that the Government of Ontario has identified the Ring of Fire mineral region as an opportunity for a corridor to prosperity that can leverage health, economic and social benefits, while unlocking significant economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Government of Canada also recognizes this region as holding important critical-mineral deposits that could support the development of value chains in strategic industries and facilitate economic prosperity in partnership with Indigenous Peoples,” Mr. Wilkinson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keean Nembhard, press secretary for Mr. Wilkinson, wrote in an e-mail to The Globe that a similar letter was sent to each of the affected First Nations communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government has historically been less bullish on the Ring of Fire and has said that various environmental studies that are under way must be completed to make sure that impact on the land and waterways is acceptable. Ottawa has also made it clear that Indigenous groups must be on board with development.\n",
      "\n",
      "While several Indigenous groups, including Marten Falls First Nation and Webequie First Nation, are broadly in favour of development, Neskantaga First Nation is opposed and has argued that it has not been adequately consulted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2006, various mining companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the region, but no mines have been built. The Ring of Fire has no roads or electricity, and it is situated in a giant swamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally promoted for its chrome deposits, in recent years attention has turned to the Ring of Fire’s nickel deposits. Alongside cobalt, lithium and graphite, nickel is a key component used in electric-car batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most promising mineral deposits in the Ring of Fire are owned by Australian private equity company Wyloo Metals Pty Ltd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perth-based Wyloo hopes to put its Eagle’s Nest nickel project into production by the end of the decade, but it needs both the Ontario and federal government to build a $2-billion all-season road that would connect Eagle’s Nest to the provincial highway network, some 300 kilometers to the south. While Ontario has pledged to pay half the cost, Ottawa remains on the fence.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We weren’t a week into May before 30,000 people had been evacuated because of dozens of fast-moving wildfires in Alberta. Structure losses were mounting, and politicians were trotting out words like “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unprecedented? Where were they in 2017, when British Columbia had its worst fire season on record and generated four simultaneous pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms? Where were they in 2016, when Fort McMurray burned – for days – along with 6,000 square kilometres of forest? What about 2011, when Slave Lake lost its town hall, library, radio station and 500 houses in a few hours?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, the current fire situation is not unprecedented, and calling it the “new normal” is offensive. There’s nothing “normal” about it. Do I sound angry? I have a right to be, and so do you. In the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists predicted that the effects of increased industrial CO2 would penetrate the “noise” of random climate fluctuations and become measurable in the form of rising global temperatures, especially at higher latitudes like ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown smoke envelops Fort McMurray in 2016, as seen from the ground on May 6 and from NASA’s Aqua satellite on May 9. Jason Franson/The Canadian Press; NASA via Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "I started working on my latest book, Fire Weather, in 2016, just days after Fort McMurray disappeared beneath a fire-borne pyrocumulus cloud 14 kilometres tall. I did so not because this was a once-in-a-lifetime fire (the intervening years have proven otherwise). I did it because I understood, way back in 2016, that if a fire could do that much damage to such a wealthy, well-equipped subarctic city when the lakes were still frozen and car-sized blocks of ice still lined the Athabasca River, imagine what it could do to more southerly towns filled with old, densely packed wooden houses? Places such as Vancouver, Moose Jaw or St. John’s? Imagine what such a fire could do in cottage country, or in the thousands of rural communities located in the wildland urban interface, where half of Canadians, and a third of Americans, now live.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was scared, but I’m also angry: This situation was foreseen more than half a century ago, and it is now upon us with a vengeance. Wildfire seasons have been lengthening, and fires have been burning with a greater destructive intensity. I call it “21st-century fire” because that’s when fire really started to get weird. Before 2000, wildfire-generated pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms were an extreme rarity. Now they are a common feature; Alberta generated several of them in the first week of May alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, and elsewhere, wildfires have traditionally been viewed as a rural problem. But as we’ve seen in recent years in Australia, the United States, Canada – and many other places – cities and towns are increasingly under threat. The area of greatest concern to Canadians is the wildland urban interface – a.k.a. the WUI (rhymes with “phooey”). The WUI is where the forest meets the built environment, i.e., those tree-lined subdivisions where so many new Canadian homes are being built. It’s a beautiful place to live, until it’s on fire. The bad news is: Whether you live in the suburbs of Victoria, Saskatoon or Calgary, your neighbourhood is more flammable than it used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what else is different about 21st-century fire: In Fort McMurray on May 3, 2016, the temperature broke the record high for that date by 6 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity plummeted to 12 per cent – drier than Death Valley. For fire, that’s as good as gasoline. The Fort McMurray fire grew so big, so fast, it overran the city in an afternoon and generated its own stratospheric storm system in the middle of what had been a bluebird Alberta day. As the city’s residents made their frantic escape, it was through apocalyptic conditions that recalled the seventh plague in the Bible’s Book of Exodus: “So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land since Egypt became a nation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was none like it since Canada became a nation, either: The exodus of May 3 was the largest, most rapid displacement of people because of fire in modern times – anywhere on Earth. So profound was the damage, and so persistent were the flames (houses and work camps were still burning down two weeks later) that the city was closed for a full month. With the sole exception of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, no other North American city has been disinhabited for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few human beings alive have experienced what tens of thousands of our fellow citizens suddenly found themselves in the middle of on that blistering spring day. It was terrifying, and, as many survivors of the fire told me, hard to believe. Some things are just too big to fit in your head, and the Fort McMurray fire was one of those things. For some, it still is. A week into the fire, then-premier Rachel Notley tried to articulate the devastation she saw: “You go to a place where there was a house and what do you see on the ground? Nails. Piles and piles of nails.”\n",

      "In ancient times, the only things that could manifest this kind of annihilating End-Times energy were volcanoes, earthquakes and angry gods. Now, after two hundred years of relentless combustion, our fossil-fuel-driven civilization has become its own volcano.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I mean by that?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easier to wrap your head around the impact of a fire-powered civilization when you get past euphemisms such as “fossil fuels,” “coal” and “oil and gas,” and call our prime mover by its true name: fire. In this historical moment, fire is what drives us, what empowers us, what enables and enriches us, and it raises a burning question: Who is empowering whom? Fires are now burning where they’ve never burned before: Greenland, the High Arctic, and in rainforests from B.C. to Brazil. In 2021, even the International Energy Agency – historically, a friend to the fossil-fuel industry – said: Enough! If we are to maintain any semblance of climate stability, we must stop building fossil-fuel projects right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the IEA is freaked out, you know we’ve turned a corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire, and our slavish devotion to its force-multiplying power, lies at the root of our current situation. With our cars and stoves and central heating, hundreds of millions of us now live like emperors of old – only instead of enslaved people and draft animals serving us, we have fire-powered machines. Most Canadians command a vast invisible retinue. Just imagine how many horses it would take to move a two-ton minivan from Toronto to Ottawa at highway speed. Thanks to superb engineering, we remain blissfully unaware of the violent explosions taking place under the minivan’s hood with every turn of the crankshaft. Thanks to disingenuous advertising and lax laws, we are equally oblivious to the 100 kilograms of CO2 trailing behind us on that single Toronto-to-Ottawa run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billions of us are engaged in these activities. Lightning strikes the Earth millions of times a day, starting thousands of fires, but lightning’s got nothing on us. For starters, about three billion people are still cooking and heating with open fires. Meanwhile, in the developed world, you’ve got hundreds of millions of gas stoves, water heaters and home furnaces. The list of flammables goes on: Wars and trash generate a lot of fires; so does slash-and-burn agriculture, so do forest fires, and so does petroleum refining. According to the National Energy Board, Alberta’s bitumen industry uses more than 57,000,000 cubic metres (two billion cubic feet) of natural gas per day – the energy equivalent of 350,000 barrels of oil – for the sole purpose of separating bitumen from sand. Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas in the world; in 2017, nearly a third of Canada’s total production was devoted to processing bitumen. Even after this colossal energy input, the rendered bitumen will still need further, fire-intensive upgrading to be actually burnable. Lest there be any confusion, natural gas is about 80 per cent methane, a greenhouse gas 50 times more potent than CO2.\n",

      "\n",
      "Already, we’re into the billions of daily human-caused fires, but it’s when I started looking at engines that the numbers really took off. Globally, you’ve got well over a billion cars, a quarter-billion trucks, 200 million motorcycles, 25,000 passenger jets, and 50,000 ocean-going freighters (a third of which are devoted to transporting more fuel to burn). A single six-cylinder minivan running at driving-to-school speed – 2,500 RPM – will generate around 10,000 combustions a minute, more than half a million per hour. That’s a lot of fires. Add them all up and you get tens of trillions of individual combustions. That, roughly speaking, is the number of fires humans make every day – uncountable as stars in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Nature: “Behold my mighty volcanoes and wildfires!” Humans: “Hold my beer.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Every single one of those fires generates CO2 emissions, and all of it stays here on Earth (no, carbon capture will not make a dent in this). A certain amount is absorbed into limestone by chemical weathering, but the bulk of anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2 is absorbed by our oceans, or set loose in our atmosphere where it remains active for decades, if not centuries. Findings published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters revealed that, over the past 40 years, roughly 40 per cent of the area burned in wildfires in the western U.S. and southwestern Canada can be traced to industrial CO2 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: When you extract, upgrade, refine and burn toxic substances such as coal, bitumen, oil and gas at the rate we are burning them, decade after decade, you’re going to see changes. Atmospheric CO2 levels are now fully 50 per cent higher than preindustrial times, and it affects everything we care about, from fetuses to phytoplankton, from water to winter. “Fire weather” is not just a book title, it’s a technical term. Natural Resources Canada uses a Fire Weather Index to gauge fire risk, and when the index is high, things we care about and depend on ignite much more easily. When Fort McMurray burned, the Fire Weather Index peaked at 42 – record territory, well beyond “Extreme.” In B.C., during the heat dome of 2021, it went far higher. Now, that was “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not unique to Canada; weather services around the world are scrambling to find new names and colours to account for these off-the-charts extremes in temperature, flammability, rainfall, ocean surge – you name it. It’s like the Spinal Tap amp that goes up to 11, only not funny: Australia’s new Fire Danger Ratings System goes from High to Extreme to Catastrophic.\n",

      "In this new, more combustible world that industrialized nations have imposed on all of us, Canada has a role to play, and culpability to own. These are challenging subjects for a major energy-producing (that is, fire-producing) country like ours. But if we are strong enough, and brave enough, to get 88,000 people out of a burning city – and then save that city – without losing a single person to the flames, then surely we can do difficult things.\n",

Meanwhile, the town of Lytton, B.C., broke national temperature records three days running, topping out at a brain-boiling 50 C. The following day, a wind-driven wildfire, started by sparks from a passing freight train, burned Lytton to the ground in half an hour. More than 500 buildings were destroyed; two people died. “I’m 60,” said Lytton’s then-mayor, Jan Polderman, “and I thought climate change was a problem for the next generation. Now, I’m mayor of a town that no longer exists.”\n",

I have stood with survivors in the ash and ruin of their lives, and trust me, you wouldn’t wish this terror and sorrow on anyone.

      "Earlier, the B.C. provincial government warned residents that a return to cooler, more seasonal spring conditions may actually raise the risk of lightning-caused wildfires after the province experienced a prolonged period of dryness and heat.\n",

      "\n",
      "A fire information officer says three of the four large wildfires that have been burning 1,200 kilometres northeast of Vancouver have not grown at all since Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Things are looking quite good,” Karley Desrosiers said on Saturday about the blazes in the Red Creek, Cameron River and Boundary Lake areas\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are expecting some rain in the forecast so, hopefully by Monday, we will get some precipitation … That will certainly reduce fire behaviour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Stoddart Creek –- the largest of the blazes –- is the only one that expanded just before the weekend, although only by a modest six square kilometres to 266 as southerly winds pushed flames north.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada is forecasting a 30-to-40 per cent chance of showers for Fort St. John on Saturday and Sunday, followed by rain on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the forecast is also calling for thunderstorms over the weekend, and Desrosiers said crews are on the watch for “dry lightning” and any new potential fires that may get ignited if rain does not fall in significant amounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, the B.C. provincial government warned residents that a return to cooler, more seasonal spring conditions may actually raise the risk of lightning-caused wildfires after the province experienced a prolonged period of dryness and heat.\n",

      "\n",
      "The other challenge that comes with cooling weather, Desrosiers said, is the changing wind direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada says northerly winds may return later this weekend, which would push the fire south again towards Highway 97 and other populated areas like Fort St. John.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is what happened on May 15, when southbound gusts exceeding 60 kilometres an hour pushed the Stoddart Creek fire and its smoke towards the city of 21,000, prompting an alert to prepare for evacuation that has since been rescinded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desrosiers said winds are currently southerly, pushing the flames north. This allows fire crews to conduct a controlled burn near Highway 97 that would significantly boost the lines of defence when the wind direction is forecasted to change back toward the south later in the weekend.\n",

      "“There’s a big pocket of unburnt fuel there that we would like to to remove in a controlled manner … while the winds are co-operative,” Desrosiers said.\n",

      "We weren’t a week into May before 30,000 people had been evacuated because of dozens of fast-moving wildfires in Alberta. Structure losses were mounting, and politicians were trotting out words like “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unprecedented? Where were they in 2017, when British Columbia had its worst fire season on record and generated four simultaneous pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms? Where were they in 2016, when Fort McMurray burned – for days – along with 6,000 square kilometres of forest? What about 2011, when Slave Lake lost its town hall, library, radio station and 500 houses in a few hours?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, the current fire situation is not unprecedented, and calling it the “new normal” is offensive. There’s nothing “normal” about it. Do I sound angry? I have a right to be, and so do you. In the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists predicted that the effects of increased industrial CO2 would penetrate the “noise” of random climate fluctuations and become measurable in the form of rising global temperatures, especially at higher latitudes like ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown smoke envelops Fort McMurray in 2016, as seen from the ground on May 6 and from NASA’s Aqua satellite on May 9. Jason Franson/The Canadian Press; NASA via Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "I started working on my latest book, Fire Weather, in 2016, just days after Fort McMurray disappeared beneath a fire-borne pyrocumulus cloud 14 kilometres tall. I did so not because this was a once-in-a-lifetime fire (the intervening years have proven otherwise). I did it because I understood, way back in 2016, that if a fire could do that much damage to such a wealthy, well-equipped subarctic city when the lakes were still frozen and car-sized blocks of ice still lined the Athabasca River, imagine what it could do to more southerly towns filled with old, densely packed wooden houses? Places such as Vancouver, Moose Jaw or St. John’s? Imagine what such a fire could do in cottage country, or in the thousands of rural communities located in the wildland urban interface, where half of Canadians, and a third of Americans, now live.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was scared, but I’m also angry: This situation was foreseen more than half a century ago, and it is now upon us with a vengeance. Wildfire seasons have been lengthening, and fires have been burning with a greater destructive intensity. I call it “21st-century fire” because that’s when fire really started to get weird. Before 2000, wildfire-generated pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms were an extreme rarity. Now they are a common feature; Alberta generated several of them in the first week of May alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, and elsewhere, wildfires have traditionally been viewed as a rural problem. But as we’ve seen in recent years in Australia, the United States, Canada – and many other places – cities and towns are increasingly under threat. The area of greatest concern to Canadians is the wildland urban interface – a.k.a. the WUI (rhymes with “phooey”). The WUI is where the forest meets the built environment, i.e., those tree-lined subdivisions where so many new Canadian homes are being built. It’s a beautiful place to live, until it’s on fire. The bad news is: Whether you live in the suburbs of Victoria, Saskatoon or Calgary, your neighbourhood is more flammable than it used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what else is different about 21st-century fire: In Fort McMurray on May 3, 2016, the temperature broke the record high for that date by 6 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity plummeted to 12 per cent – drier than Death Valley. For fire, that’s as good as gasoline. The Fort McMurray fire grew so big, so fast, it overran the city in an afternoon and generated its own stratospheric storm system in the middle of what had been a bluebird Alberta day. As the city’s residents made their frantic escape, it was through apocalyptic conditions that recalled the seventh plague in the Bible’s Book of Exodus: “So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land since Egypt became a nation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was none like it since Canada became a nation, either: The exodus of May 3 was the largest, most rapid displacement of people because of fire in modern times – anywhere on Earth. So profound was the damage, and so persistent were the flames (houses and work camps were still burning down two weeks later) that the city was closed for a full month. With the sole exception of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, no other North American city has been disinhabited for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few human beings alive have experienced what tens of thousands of our fellow citizens suddenly found themselves in the middle of on that blistering spring day. It was terrifying, and, as many survivors of the fire told me, hard to believe. Some things are just too big to fit in your head, and the Fort McMurray fire was one of those things. For some, it still is. A week into the fire, then-premier Rachel Notley tried to articulate the devastation she saw: “You go to a place where there was a house and what do you see on the ground? Nails. Piles and piles of nails.”\n",

      "In ancient times, the only things that could manifest this kind of annihilating End-Times energy were volcanoes, earthquakes and angry gods. Now, after two hundred years of relentless combustion, our fossil-fuel-driven civilization has become its own volcano.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I mean by that?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easier to wrap your head around the impact of a fire-powered civilization when you get past euphemisms such as “fossil fuels,” “coal” and “oil and gas,” and call our prime mover by its true name: fire. In this historical moment, fire is what drives us, what empowers us, what enables and enriches us, and it raises a burning question: Who is empowering whom? Fires are now burning where they’ve never burned before: Greenland, the High Arctic, and in rainforests from B.C. to Brazil. In 2021, even the International Energy Agency – historically, a friend to the fossil-fuel industry – said: Enough! If we are to maintain any semblance of climate stability, we must stop building fossil-fuel projects right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the IEA is freaked out, you know we’ve turned a corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire, and our slavish devotion to its force-multiplying power, lies at the root of our current situation. With our cars and stoves and central heating, hundreds of millions of us now live like emperors of old – only instead of enslaved people and draft animals serving us, we have fire-powered machines. Most Canadians command a vast invisible retinue. Just imagine how many horses it would take to move a two-ton minivan from Toronto to Ottawa at highway speed. Thanks to superb engineering, we remain blissfully unaware of the violent explosions taking place under the minivan’s hood with every turn of the crankshaft. Thanks to disingenuous advertising and lax laws, we are equally oblivious to the 100 kilograms of CO2 trailing behind us on that single Toronto-to-Ottawa run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billions of us are engaged in these activities. Lightning strikes the Earth millions of times a day, starting thousands of fires, but lightning’s got nothing on us. For starters, about three billion people are still cooking and heating with open fires. Meanwhile, in the developed world, you’ve got hundreds of millions of gas stoves, water heaters and home furnaces. The list of flammables goes on: Wars and trash generate a lot of fires; so does slash-and-burn agriculture, so do forest fires, and so does petroleum refining. According to the National Energy Board, Alberta’s bitumen industry uses more than 57,000,000 cubic metres (two billion cubic feet) of natural gas per day – the energy equivalent of 350,000 barrels of oil – for the sole purpose of separating bitumen from sand. Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas in the world; in 2017, nearly a third of Canada’s total production was devoted to processing bitumen. Even after this colossal energy input, the rendered bitumen will still need further, fire-intensive upgrading to be actually burnable. Lest there be any confusion, natural gas is about 80 per cent methane, a greenhouse gas 50 times more potent than CO2.\n",

      "Already, we’re into the billions of daily human-caused fires, but it’s when I started looking at engines that the numbers really took off. Globally, you’ve got well over a billion cars, a quarter-billion trucks, 200 million motorcycles, 25,000 passenger jets, and 50,000 ocean-going freighters (a third of which are devoted to transporting more fuel to burn). A single six-cylinder minivan running at driving-to-school speed – 2,500 RPM – will generate around 10,000 combustions a minute, more than half a million per hour. That’s a lot of fires. Add them all up and you get tens of trillions of individual combustions. That, roughly speaking, is the number of fires humans make every day – uncountable as stars in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Nature: “Behold my mighty volcanoes and wildfires!” Humans: “Hold my beer.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Every single one of those fires generates CO2 emissions, and all of it stays here on Earth (no, carbon capture will not make a dent in this). A certain amount is absorbed into limestone by chemical weathering, but the bulk of anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2 is absorbed by our oceans, or set loose in our atmosphere where it remains active for decades, if not centuries. Findings published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters revealed that, over the past 40 years, roughly 40 per cent of the area burned in wildfires in the western U.S. and southwestern Canada can be traced to industrial CO2 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: When you extract, upgrade, refine and burn toxic substances such as coal, bitumen, oil and gas at the rate we are burning them, decade after decade, you’re going to see changes. Atmospheric CO2 levels are now fully 50 per cent higher than preindustrial times, and it affects everything we care about, from fetuses to phytoplankton, from water to winter. “Fire weather” is not just a book title, it’s a technical term. Natural Resources Canada uses a Fire Weather Index to gauge fire risk, and when the index is high, things we care about and depend on ignite much more easily. When Fort McMurray burned, the Fire Weather Index peaked at 42 – record territory, well beyond “Extreme.” In B.C., during the heat dome of 2021, it went far higher. Now, that was “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not unique to Canada; weather services around the world are scrambling to find new names and colours to account for these off-the-charts extremes in temperature, flammability, rainfall, ocean surge – you name it. It’s like the Spinal Tap amp that goes up to 11, only not funny: Australia’s new Fire Danger Ratings System goes from High to Extreme to Catastrophic.\n",

      "Bruce Linton was the founder and co-CEO of Canopy Growth, the first publicly traded cannabis company in North America. When weed first became legal in Canada, Bruce was riding the high. Under his leadership, Canopy grew into a company valued at around $18-billion. Bruce, in many ways, became the face of the cannabis boom. But things ended badly between Bruce and the company he created. Cannabis sales failed to meet the hype and in 2019, he was fired by the board. So what led to one of the most public business failures in recent memory? Bruce talks about how he got fired, why the cannabis sector hasn’t delivered on its colossal promise and what’s next for him.\n"

      "The world must transition to net zero. Canada is playing its part as a global citizen to slow climate change, with the spring 2023 budget directing $21-billion in tax credits to drive investment in low-carbon technology. That part of Canada’s climate policy is solid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where financial commitment to climate change is less firm, and more urgent, however, is in adapting to extreme weather. Think flooding, wildfire, extreme heat and a longer list of perils wreaking growing havoc on people and the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the current Alberta wildfires unfold, it is worth remembering that the last episode, in 2016, cost nearly $9-billion. This ongoing devastation in Alberta, which comes as parts of neighbouring British Columbia also burn, should reinforce the need for our government to commit more funds to combatting such extreme-weather events.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring budget, funding directed to help Canadians and businesses adapt to climate change totalled about $25-million per year. Most of this funding was directed to establishing affordable flood insurance for residents in high-risk areas, and to modernizing federal disaster transfers to provinces in the aftermath of flooding. For wildfire and extreme heat, the budget was largely silent, which was surprising with widespread wildfire, and 619 heat-related deaths in British Columbia alone in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funding in the budget built upon $1.6-billion announced in 2022 to mobilize adaptation practices outlined in the National Adaptation Strategy (NAS). The NAS was an important commitment for which the government deserves credit. While funding for the NAS – which Public Safety Minister Bill Blair described as a “down-payment” – moves Canada in the right direction, a large climate adaptation funding gap remains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moyles: Alberta had one of the best wildfire programs in the world. Budget cuts have left the province at risk\n",
      "\n",
      "Disparity on investment in climate resilience across perils exists not only within Canada, but also in comparison to Canada’s largest trading partner, the United States. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act last year provided about US$30-billion for climate adaptation, directed to agricultural practices, forest fire protection and the fortification of coastlines. Additionally, President Joe Biden’s 2023 budget provided another US$18-billion for climate resilience and adaptation programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the above figures, federal per capita investment in adaptation in the U.S. is roughly three to four times that of Canada. As lopsided as this may sound, there is another wrinkle. Canada is warming at three times the rate of the U.S., which is creating more intense, and costly, weather across provinces and territories.\n",
      "\n",
      "As extreme weather continues to expose vulnerabilities in supply chains, electricity grids, transportation corridors, communications networks and seemingly endless infrastructure interdependencies, there is little doubt that Canada’s GDP will be disproportionately affected relative to the more resilient U.S. economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So where should Canada invest to catch up and start to close its adaptation gap?\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, funding for the Greener Homes Initiative, administered by Natural Resources Canada, should be increased by $1-billion, spread over five years starting in 2023. Currently, the program focuses on providing grants to improve the energy efficiency of homes – new funding should be directed to adaptation, to provide home flood protection and energy efficiency in one-stop shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Disaster Mitigation Adaptation Fund is an Infrastructure Canada program that supports public infrastructure projects designed to mitigate current and future climate-related risks and disasters such as floods, wildfires and droughts. DMAF funding should be raised to $10-billion distributed over five years beginning in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above financial commitments may seem sizable, but they are investments to protect Canada’s economy. There is a misconception that investing in adaptation is expensive. Studies by the Global Commission on Adaptation (of which Canada is a founding member), World Resources Institute, Insurance Bureau of Canada and Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation, all find that $1 invested in adaptation yields, conservatively, $3 to $8 in avoided losses per decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is urgent that both the federal government, and the private sector, invest to limit the growing costs of extreme weather. The spring 2023 “greenhouse gas mitigation budget” should be complemented with a fall “climate adaptation economic statement.” Closing the adaptation gap will position Canada to protect people and the economy as weather continues to get more challenging driven by irreversible climate change.\n"

      "We weren’t a week into May before 30,000 people had been evacuated because of dozens of fast-moving wildfires in Alberta. Structure losses were mounting, and politicians were trotting out words like “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unprecedented? Where were they in 2017, when British Columbia had its worst fire season on record and generated four simultaneous pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms? Where were they in 2016, when Fort McMurray burned – for days – along with 6,000 square kilometres of forest? What about 2011, when Slave Lake lost its town hall, library, radio station and 500 houses in a few hours?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, the current fire situation is not unprecedented, and calling it the “new normal” is offensive. There’s nothing “normal” about it. Do I sound angry? I have a right to be, and so do you. In the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists predicted that the effects of increased industrial CO2 would penetrate the “noise” of random climate fluctuations and become measurable in the form of rising global temperatures, especially at higher latitudes like ours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown smoke envelops Fort McMurray in 2016, as seen from the ground on May 6 and from NASA’s Aqua satellite on May 9. Jason Franson/The Canadian Press; NASA via Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "I started working on my latest book, Fire Weather, in 2016, just days after Fort McMurray disappeared beneath a fire-borne pyrocumulus cloud 14 kilometres tall. I did so not because this was a once-in-a-lifetime fire (the intervening years have proven otherwise). I did it because I understood, way back in 2016, that if a fire could do that much damage to such a wealthy, well-equipped subarctic city when the lakes were still frozen and car-sized blocks of ice still lined the Athabasca River, imagine what it could do to more southerly towns filled with old, densely packed wooden houses? Places such as Vancouver, Moose Jaw or St. John’s? Imagine what such a fire could do in cottage country, or in the thousands of rural communities located in the wildland urban interface, where half of Canadians, and a third of Americans, now live.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was scared, but I’m also angry: This situation was foreseen more than half a century ago, and it is now upon us with a vengeance. Wildfire seasons have been lengthening, and fires have been burning with a greater destructive intensity. I call it “21st-century fire” because that’s when fire really started to get weird. Before 2000, wildfire-generated pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms were an extreme rarity. Now they are a common feature; Alberta generated several of them in the first week of May alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, and elsewhere, wildfires have traditionally been viewed as a rural problem. But as we’ve seen in recent years in Australia, the United States, Canada – and many other places – cities and towns are increasingly under threat. The area of greatest concern to Canadians is the wildland urban interface – a.k.a. the WUI (rhymes with “phooey”). The WUI is where the forest meets the built environment, i.e., those tree-lined subdivisions where so many new Canadian homes are being built. It’s a beautiful place to live, until it’s on fire. The bad news is: Whether you live in the suburbs of Victoria, Saskatoon or Calgary, your neighbourhood is more flammable than it used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what else is different about 21st-century fire: In Fort McMurray on May 3, 2016, the temperature broke the record high for that date by 6 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity plummeted to 12 per cent – drier than Death Valley. For fire, that’s as good as gasoline. The Fort McMurray fire grew so big, so fast, it overran the city in an afternoon and generated its own stratospheric storm system in the middle of what had been a bluebird Alberta day. As the city’s residents made their frantic escape, it was through apocalyptic conditions that recalled the seventh plague in the Bible’s Book of Exodus: “So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land since Egypt became a nation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was none like it since Canada became a nation, either: The exodus of May 3 was the largest, most rapid displacement of people because of fire in modern times – anywhere on Earth. So profound was the damage, and so persistent were the flames (houses and work camps were still burning down two weeks later) that the city was closed for a full month. With the sole exception of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, no other North American city has been disinhabited for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few human beings alive have experienced what tens of thousands of our fellow citizens suddenly found themselves in the middle of on that blistering spring day. It was terrifying, and, as many survivors of the fire told me, hard to believe. Some things are just too big to fit in your head, and the Fort McMurray fire was one of those things. For some, it still is. A week into the fire, then-premier Rachel Notley tried to articulate the devastation she saw: “You go to a place where there was a house and what do you see on the ground? Nails. Piles and piles of nails.”\n",

      "In ancient times, the only things that could manifest this kind of annihilating End-Times energy were volcanoes, earthquakes and angry gods. Now, after two hundred years of relentless combustion, our fossil-fuel-driven civilization has become its own volcano.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I mean by that?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easier to wrap your head around the impact of a fire-powered civilization when you get past euphemisms such as “fossil fuels,” “coal” and “oil and gas,” and call our prime mover by its true name: fire. In this historical moment, fire is what drives us, what empowers us, what enables and enriches us, and it raises a burning question: Who is empowering whom? Fires are now burning where they’ve never burned before: Greenland, the High Arctic, and in rainforests from B.C. to Brazil. In 2021, even the International Energy Agency – historically, a friend to the fossil-fuel industry – said: Enough! If we are to maintain any semblance of climate stability, we must stop building fossil-fuel projects right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the IEA is freaked out, you know we’ve turned a corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire, and our slavish devotion to its force-multiplying power, lies at the root of our current situation. With our cars and stoves and central heating, hundreds of millions of us now live like emperors of old – only instead of enslaved people and draft animals serving us, we have fire-powered machines. Most Canadians command a vast invisible retinue. Just imagine how many horses it would take to move a two-ton minivan from Toronto to Ottawa at highway speed. Thanks to superb engineering, we remain blissfully unaware of the violent explosions taking place under the minivan’s hood with every turn of the crankshaft. Thanks to disingenuous advertising and lax laws, we are equally oblivious to the 100 kilograms of CO2 trailing behind us on that single Toronto-to-Ottawa run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billions of us are engaged in these activities. Lightning strikes the Earth millions of times a day, starting thousands of fires, but lightning’s got nothing on us. For starters, about three billion people are still cooking and heating with open fires. Meanwhile, in the developed world, you’ve got hundreds of millions of gas stoves, water heaters and home furnaces. The list of flammables goes on: Wars and trash generate a lot of fires; so does slash-and-burn agriculture, so do forest fires, and so does petroleum refining. According to the National Energy Board, Alberta’s bitumen industry uses more than 57,000,000 cubic metres (two billion cubic feet) of natural gas per day – the energy equivalent of 350,000 barrels of oil – for the sole purpose of separating bitumen from sand. Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas in the world; in 2017, nearly a third of Canada’s total production was devoted to processing bitumen. Even after this colossal energy input, the rendered bitumen will still need further, fire-intensive upgrading to be actually burnable. Lest there be any confusion, natural gas is about 80 per cent methane, a greenhouse gas 50 times more potent than CO2.\n",

      "Already, we’re into the billions of daily human-caused fires, but it’s when I started looking at engines that the numbers really took off. Globally, you’ve got well over a billion cars, a quarter-billion trucks, 200 million motorcycles, 25,000 passenger jets, and 50,000 ocean-going freighters (a third of which are devoted to transporting more fuel to burn). A single six-cylinder minivan running at driving-to-school speed – 2,500 RPM – will generate around 10,000 combustions a minute, more than half a million per hour. That’s a lot of fires. Add them all up and you get tens of trillions of individual combustions. That, roughly speaking, is the number of fires humans make every day – uncountable as stars in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Nature: “Behold my mighty volcanoes and wildfires!” Humans: “Hold my beer.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Every single one of those fires generates CO2 emissions, and all of it stays here on Earth (no, carbon capture will not make a dent in this). A certain amount is absorbed into limestone by chemical weathering, but the bulk of anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2 is absorbed by our oceans, or set loose in our atmosphere where it remains active for decades, if not centuries. Findings published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters revealed that, over the past 40 years, roughly 40 per cent of the area burned in wildfires in the western U.S. and southwestern Canada can be traced to industrial CO2 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: When you extract, upgrade, refine and burn toxic substances such as coal, bitumen, oil and gas at the rate we are burning them, decade after decade, you’re going to see changes. Atmospheric CO2 levels are now fully 50 per cent higher than preindustrial times, and it affects everything we care about, from fetuses to phytoplankton, from water to winter. “Fire weather” is not just a book title, it’s a technical term. Natural Resources Canada uses a Fire Weather Index to gauge fire risk, and when the index is high, things we care about and depend on ignite much more easily. When Fort McMurray burned, the Fire Weather Index peaked at 42 – record territory, well beyond “Extreme.” In B.C., during the heat dome of 2021, it went far higher. Now, that was “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not unique to Canada; weather services around the world are scrambling to find new names and colours to account for these off-the-charts extremes in temperature, flammability, rainfall, ocean surge – you name it. It’s like the Spinal Tap amp that goes up to 11, only not funny: Australia’s new Fire Danger Ratings System goes from High to Extreme to Catastrophic.\n",

      "Where financial commitment to climate change is less firm, and more urgent, however, is in adapting to extreme weather. Think flooding, wildfire, extreme heat and a longer list of perils wreaking growing havoc on people and the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the current Alberta wildfires unfold, it is worth remembering that the last episode, in 2016, cost nearly $9-billion. This ongoing devastation in Alberta, which comes as parts of neighbouring British Columbia also burn, should reinforce the need for our government to commit more funds to combatting such extreme-weather events.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring budget, funding directed to help Canadians and businesses adapt to climate change totalled about $25-million per year. Most of this funding was directed to establishing affordable flood insurance for residents in high-risk areas, and to modernizing federal disaster transfers to provinces in the aftermath of flooding. For wildfire and extreme heat, the budget was largely silent, which was surprising with widespread wildfire, and 619 heat-related deaths in British Columbia alone in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funding in the budget built upon $1.6-billion announced in 2022 to mobilize adaptation practices outlined in the National Adaptation Strategy (NAS). The NAS was an important commitment for which the government deserves credit. While funding for the NAS – which Public Safety Minister Bill Blair described as a “down-payment” – moves Canada in the right direction, a large climate adaptation funding gap remains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta wildfire fighters hope rain, cooler temperature will bring relief\n",
      "\n",
      "Moyles: Alberta had one of the best wildfire programs in the world. Budget cuts have left the province at risk\n",
      "\n",
      "Disparity on investment in climate resilience across perils exists not only within Canada, but also in comparison to Canada’s largest trading partner, the United States. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act last year provided about US$30-billion for climate adaptation, directed to agricultural practices, forest fire protection and the fortification of coastlines. Additionally, President Joe Biden’s 2023 budget provided another US$18-billion for climate resilience and adaptation programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the above figures, federal per capita investment in adaptation in the U.S. is roughly three to four times that of Canada. As lopsided as this may sound, there is another wrinkle. Canada is warming at three times the rate of the U.S., which is creating more intense, and costly, weather across provinces and territories.\n",
      "\n",
      "As extreme weather continues to expose vulnerabilities in supply chains, electricity grids, transportation corridors, communications networks and seemingly endless infrastructure interdependencies, there is little doubt that Canada’s GDP will be disproportionately affected relative to the more resilient U.S. economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So where should Canada invest to catch up and start to close its adaptation gap?\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, funding for the Greener Homes Initiative, administered by Natural Resources Canada, should be increased by $1-billion, spread over five years starting in 2023. Currently, the program focuses on providing grants to improve the energy efficiency of homes – new funding should be directed to adaptation, to provide home flood protection and energy efficiency in one-stop shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Disaster Mitigation Adaptation Fund is an Infrastructure Canada program that supports public infrastructure projects designed to mitigate current and future climate-related risks and disasters such as floods, wildfires and droughts. DMAF funding should be raised to $10-billion distributed over five years beginning in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above financial commitments may seem sizable, but they are investments to protect Canada’s economy. There is a misconception that investing in adaptation is expensive. Studies by the Global Commission on Adaptation (of which Canada is a founding member), World Resources Institute, Insurance Bureau of Canada and Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation, all find that $1 invested in adaptation yields, conservatively, $3 to $8 in avoided losses per decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is urgent that both the federal government, and the private sector, invest to limit the growing costs of extreme weather. The spring 2023 “greenhouse gas mitigation budget” should be complemented with a fall “climate adaptation economic statement.” Closing the adaptation gap will position Canada to protect people and the economy as weather continues to get more challenging driven by irreversible climate change.\n"

      "\n",
      "If you have tried to clean a fireplace or, worse, had to scatter the cremated remains of a loved one, you probably held your breath. You didn’t want to inhale any of the grayish particles that surrounded you. But ash is strong stuff. It adheres to your skin, finds its way into your nasal passages and clings to your clothes as stubbornly as cheap Christmas tree tinsel. Ash — whether on a hearth or in an urn — beckons you to remember what once was and taunts you because it will never be again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his absorbing new book, “Built From the Fire: The Epic Story of Tulsa’s Greenwood District, America’s Black Wall Street,” Victor Luckerson combs through layers of soot and ash, the physical and psychological residue of the Tulsa race massacre, which continues to haunt the city’s Black community more than a century after it occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of two days in the spring of 1921, Tulsa’s Greenwood district was destroyed and hundreds of its residents were killed. Heralded as a model of Black entrepreneurial success and self-determination in the Jim Crow era, Greenwood became a target of violence when a rumor spread that Dick Rowland, a Black teenager, had sexually assaulted a white woman in an elevator. A show of force by Greenwood men to prevent Rowland from being lynched escalated into an all-out attack on Black Tulsans by white vigilantes, who in some cases had been handed arms by the police. As Luckerson recounts, “More than 1,200 houses were leveled, nearly every business was burned to the ground and an unknown number of people — estimates reach as high as 300 — were killed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckerson, a journalist based in Tulsa, adeptly takes us through Greenwood’s history, resisting the impulse to glorify its founders or endorse the idea that more Black-owned businesses can repair the ravages of racial capitalism. Instead, he introduces a bevy of figures who, seeking escape from the post-Reconstruction South, went to Tulsa in the early 1900s and helped establish Greenwood as the “Eden of the West.”\n"

      "\n",
      "I worked for Alberta Wildfire for seven years as a lookout observer, climbing a 100-foot tower and watching for smoke from April to September. In 2016, my first season, on my fourth day on the job, I witnessed a grassfire take off in the scorching hot, bone-dry conditions of early May. Within minutes, not one, but four giant columns of smoke exploded. The fires were caused by sparks cast from the friction of a train braking along the tracks and catching in the cured grass. Grassfires can race at the speed of 25 kilometres an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "More impressive than the rate of spread of the wildfires, however, was the speed at which Alberta’s firefighting response system was triggered into action. The tower to my east, manned by a veteran lookout, or “lifer” as we call them, reported the locations of the fires to the district’s duty officer. A radio dispatcher answered and dispatched firefighting crews, manned up at a neighbouring location, and tankers toward the location of the fire. Within minutes, the wildfire was confirmed. The radio erupted with voices. I watched tankers hit the flames with red clay retardant to box the fire in. Multiple crews landed to work the fire from the ground. As a rookie lookout, I was in awe. The system worked so effectively because the people within it had built up multiple seasons of experience in their respective roles. Within a few hours, there was no trace of smoke. The firefighters had protected a nearby community from the fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the world of wildfire management, experience matters. Experience is what keeps communities safe from wildfires and firefighters safe on the fire line. Experience results in a faster, more efficient delivery of wildfire detection, assessment and management. Experience can only be achieved in a system where people feel valued, fairly compensated, and have the opportunity to learn and grow within the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a system, Alberta Wildfire was a culture of individuals called to the line of wildfire response, people who lived and breathed for “fire season,” who planned and sacrificed their lives around it. Firefighter crew leaders often had more than seven years of experience. Most of my neighbouring tower workers had, on average, double that. Many of the managers and rangers were former firefighters who had decades of on-the-ground experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "A series of government cutbacks and defunding, however, has seriously damaged Alberta Wildfire’s ability to prevent and respond to wildfires. The NDP cut $15-million from the budget in 2016. Three years later, the United Conservative Party (UCP), despite the severity of the 2019 fire season in Alberta, with multiple northern and Indigenous communities affected by the Chuckegg Creek and McMillan wildfire complexes, subsequently deepened those cuts. In November, 2019, they slashed the Rappel Attack Program (RAP), a 40-year-old program that trained firefighters to propel from helicopters into remote areas. They also decommissioned 26 fire towers, one-fifth of the province’s lookout detection program. Then-agriculture and forestry minister, Devin Dreeshen, told the CBC, “We don’t want politics getting in the way of how we fight fires. We want experts in the actual field to actually say how we should actually fight fires.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the UCP have done anything but listen to wildfire experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest on the Alberta wildfires\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, they’ve ignored expertise generated from historical wildfire events that built up and bolstered Alberta Wildfire’s effectiveness. The Flat Top Complex Wildfire Review, a report released in 2012, recommended the government hire additional wildfire rangers and crews for doing sustained action on wildfire complexes, while commencing firefighter training earlier in April to prepare for large-scale wildfires in May. From 2020 to 2021, the UCP cut permanent staff in Alberta Wildfire, including wildfire rangers – people hired from that very report – and regional information officers, who were responsible for educating the public to prevent wildfires and keep informed on active wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite evidence from experts that climate change is predicted to lengthen the fire season, increase lightning ignition and the frequency of wildfires, along with fire intensity and area burned, in the spring of 2022, the UCP government cut the contractual seasons of wildfire response personnel, including firefighters, dispatchers and lookouts, by 10 per cent. As a result, there are fewer firefighters trained and ready to deploy in early May than in previous seasons. Most seasonal personnel were laid off mid-August last year, including the early closing of fire towers, despite the extreme fire hazard and potential for wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "In four short years, the UCP has created a firefighter retention crisis, or a “brain drain” of experienced firefighters leaving Alberta Wildfire for other agencies that offer longer seasons and opportunity for full-time employment. I’ve been told that in some districts, 60 per cent of firefighters are first-years – with no previous fire experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "That can result in reduced efficiency managing wildfires, says Désirée Gerber, a former firefighter in Alberta who worked nine fire seasons in the province. “Many [firefighters] are becoming leaders with little experience,” Ms. Gerber says. “This can lead to poorer decisions and can cost more.” She cites an example of an inexperienced crew leader requesting costly air-tanker assistance to manage a wildfire, whereas a more experienced leader would manage the fire with ground crews and a medium-sized helicopter. Because of cuts to the length of her season and lack of opportunity for full-time employment, Ms. Gerber was forced to seek employment opportunities elsewhere. “While I felt valued by my peers and supervisor, I didn’t feel valued by upper management,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, despite the experience and confidence that I built up over seven years at the fire tower, reporting wildfires when they were still small and easy to manage, because of the whittling down of my contract from five to four months, I made the decision to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "This choice, however, enables me to do what my colleagues working hard on the front lines of Alberta’s 2023 wildfire disaster can’t do. Speak out. Admit that many good, talented people working inside the constraints of policy and budget cuts feared this very situation would happen. That, because of cuts and the dismantling of what used to be considered one of the best wildfire programs in the world, Alberta was hugely underprepared to face the fire in the first days of May.\n",
      "\n",
      "The science from experts has been clear for over a decade: Wildfires will continue to shock us. In the wake of the provincial election in Alberta, whoever is elected to power, it’s imperative to reinvest in the people working in wildfire management for the safety of our communities.\n"

Under his leadership, Canopy grew into a company valued at around $18-billion. Bruce, in many ways, became the face of the cannabis boom. But things ended badly between Bruce and the company he created. Cannabis sales failed to meet the hype and in 2019, he was fired by the board.

      "Article content An emotional Bernardeschi raised eyebrows in a post-game virtual availability in Austin with a frustrated outburst that seemed directed at his coach. “We don’t play,” the Italian, the fourth-highest-paid player in the league at $6.295 million US this season, said in English. “We play long pass. We don’t have any idea to play.” “I think this city, the fans, everybody, don’t deserve this,” he added. “And I think maybe we need to change something. We need a little bit more tactics. We need an idea how we play, because this is the real problem for me. It’s impossible to play like this when we play without (an) idea.” Asked whether the problem was in executing the game plan or the game plan itself, Bernardeschi replied: “We don’t have a construction in the game. When the player has the ball, we don’t know how to pass the ball. This is the real problem. Because we don’t train about that.\n",

Former Canadian international Kaylyn Kyle, a co-host of “MLS 360” on Apple TV, added fuel to the fire on Monday’s MLS Extratime podcast by saying Insigne did not want to work with Bradley, citing “a source close to the situation in Toronto.” There were also suggestions on social media that Insigne had indeed made the trip to Austin only to have a disagreement with Bradley.\n",

I don’t know where people get their information about this situation because there was no dispute between Lorenzo and the coach. “It was very clear to the whole team that he thought it was best for him to stay back and be assessed. And we supported that and respected that and we just moved forward as a team and took the guys who were ready to play to Austin.” Bradley, who normally only meets the media immediately before and after games, was not available to speak Tuesday. The rumour mill and accompanying outside noise are the last thing the struggling team needs, with more than a few supporters using social media to vent their frustration at the club’s lack of progress.\n",

      "\n",
      "Andrew Forrest, the Australian billionaire owner of the most promising mining assets in Ontario’s Ring of Fire region, says the viability of the critical minerals project is at risk because of Canada’s regulatory burden, its cumbersome consultation process and persistent delays in building crucial infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring of Fire, in the province’s far north, is a key part of Ontario’s and Canada’s plans to become a player in metals for electric-vehicle batteries, but it has sat undeveloped for the better part of two decades owing to unproven economics, tension with Indigenous communities, a lack of political consensus and the gigantic capital cost requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has taken on added importance over the past year, as the Canadian and U.S. governments have vowed to build up North American supplies of critical minerals in an effort to wean themselves off supplies from China amid national security concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opinion: To develop Ontario’s Ring of Fire, we must develop trust with First Nations\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally promoted for its chromite deposits, in recent years attention has turned to the Ring of Fire’s Eagle’s Nest nickel project. Alongside cobalt, lithium and graphite, nickel is a key component of EV batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December, Mr. Forrest warned that Eagle’s Nest and its associated battery metals plant are in peril, owing to the glacial pace of development in Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Timelines to advance environmental assessments, permitting and construction of the infrastructure corridor and Eagle’s Nest, as well as far-reaching consultation requirements are placing the viability of the project at risk,” he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If these standard processes continue without amendment, there is no prospect of commencing development of the Ring of Fire, or of the battery metals plant, before mid- to late 2030s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perth-based Wyloo Metals Pty Ltd., which is controlled by Mr. Forrest, last year acquired Ring of Fire Metals (then Noront Resources Ltd.) in a bidding war for $617-million.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the letter to Mr. Trudeau, he raised the spectre of Wyloo possibly abandoning the Ring of Fire, saying that “investment will be difficult to sustain” if the delays continue. He called on Mr. Trudeau to take “decisive government action.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Forrest was not available for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keean Nembhard, press secretary for Jonathan Wilkinson, federal minister of natural resources, wrote in an email to the Globe that Canada’s permitting process is already ahead of many of its global peers with respect to environmental protection, Indigenous consultation, and timelines. He added that that the federal government is committed to a regulatory system that enhances Canada’s global competitiveness, while protecting the safety of Canadians and the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, mining and infrastructure projects generally require both federal and provincial environmental reviews, as well as permits from both levels of government, a process that can lead to a duplication of effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six provincial and federal environmental studies are under way into the proposed construction of roads into the Ring of Fire. None are anywhere near being approved. An additional federal review that proposes to look at how mining development will affect the entire region was ordered in 2020, but so far stakeholders have been unable to even reach agreement on its terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural Resources Canada acknowledged in its critical minerals strategy last year that getting a Canadian mine into production can take as long as 25 years, far longer than in other major mining jurisdictions such as Western Australia. Ottawa vowed to find ways to speed up the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government said in its budget in March that by the end of the year it will come up with a plan to improve the efficiency of environmental impact assessments and permitting, including “clarifying and reducing timelines, mitigating inefficiencies, and improving engagement and partnerships.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ottawa also committed $10.6-million for critical mineral developers to navigate red tape and $40-million to support northern regulatory processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Nembhard said that the federal government is also looking at entering into more equivalency agreements with the provinces that would reduce duplication in environmental assessments by conducting a single study for a mining project, as opposed to two. Ottawa already has such an agreement in place with British Columbia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mining projects also require extensive consultation with affected First Nations communities. Because the Ring of Fire project encompasses such a large area, many communities are involved and reaching consensus has been impossible so far, despite more than a decade of consultation that started under then-premier Dalton McGuinty, continued under Kathleen Wynne and has since passed to Doug Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ford, who appointed a former mining executive as his Mines Minister last year, has at times angered Indigenous communities in the region, vowing repeatedly that development in the Ring of Fire will move ahead even if he has to jump on a bulldozer himself to get it going.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some communities, including Marten Falls First Nation and Webequie First Nation, are in favour of development, several others are opposed. Two senior leaders of Neskantaga First Nation were escorted out of the provincial legislature in March after shouting at Mr. Ford and accusing him of failing to adequately consult on Ring of Fire development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2006, various mining companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to open up development in the region, but no mines have been built. While permitting and red tape are part of the problem, the gigantic costs of development have also been a huge stumbling block.\n",

      "[] 2023-05-23 07:29:33-04:00 A guaranteed way to instantly save on investment fees is to dump your adviser and switch to exchange-traded funds tracking major stock and bond indexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fees advisers get for their work with clients can be in the 1-to-1.5-per-cent range. That’s money that would otherwise remain in the hands of their clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there’s more to the math of switching from an adviser to index investing. Advisers ideally provide valuable services for the fees they charge, including investment management, financial planning and coaching. Be sure to factor this into the analysis of advice versus DIY.\n",
      "\n",
      "I often get queries from readers about dumping an adviser to save on fees. Here’s the latest: “Today I read an article that reminded me that index funds might be a better way of investing than having an adviser pick stocks for your registered retirement savings plan. So, how does one set up an RRSP without an adviser which contains an index fund (or several of them)?”\n",
      "\n",
      "DIY index investing in an RRSP or any other type of account can be done through any digital broker. Accounts can often be opened online. From there, you need to transfer cash into the new account, choose some ETFs and buy them using your broker’s website or mobile app. An ETF portfolio can be assembled with fees as low as 0.08 per cent, plus potential stock-trading commissions to buy and sell funds. No question, DIY index investing is a money saver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s go beyond fees with a look at five ways firing an adviser could work against you:\n",
      "\n",
      "You don’t have a financial plan to guide your investing : Good advisers base their investment plans for clients on a financial plan that maps out how financial goals will be reached. Key points covered in a plan include how much you need to invest over the years and what return you need to reach your goals. In other words, how much risk you need to take on.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Good advisers base their investment plans for clients on a financial plan that maps out how financial goals will be reached. Key points covered in a plan include how much you need to invest over the years and what return you need to reach your goals. In other words, how much risk you need to take on. You don’t diversify properly : Too much in stocks could overexpose you to market downturns and tempt you to sell at low points. Too little in stocks could deny you the returns you need to generate.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Too much in stocks could overexpose you to market downturns and tempt you to sell at low points. Too little in stocks could deny you the returns you need to generate. You suffer from analysis paralysis : Overwhelmed by information, you let cash sit idle in your investment account. Expect zero interest paid on this money.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Overwhelmed by information, you let cash sit idle in your investment account. Expect zero interest paid on this money. You think you can outsmart the market : Market-timing traps include going to cash because you hear a recession is coming, then waiting too long to get back into the market.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Market-timing traps include going to cash because you hear a recession is coming, then waiting too long to get back into the market. You stop adding new money to your account and miss opportunities to buy during market lows: Good advisers keep you on a regular investment plan and encourage you to take advantage of bargains when prices fall. On your own, you miss these opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a complete no-brainer to say that DIY investing saves you a lot on fees compared with having an adviser. But what’s the value you get from those fees?\n"

      "We weren’t a week into May before 30,000 people had been evacuated because of dozens of fast-moving wildfires in Alberta. Structure losses were mounting, and politicians were trotting out words like “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unprecedented? Where were they in 2017, when British Columbia had its worst fire season on record and generated four simultaneous pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms? Where were they in 2016, when Fort McMurray burned – for days – along with 6,000 square kilometres of forest? What about 2011, when Slave Lake lost its town hall, library, radio station and 500 houses in a few hours?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, the current fire situation is not unprecedented, and calling it the “new normal” is offensive. There’s nothing “normal” about it. Do I sound angry? I have a right to be, and so do you. In the late 1970s, Exxon’s own scientists predicted that the effects of increased industrial CO2 would penetrate the “noise” of random climate fluctuations and become measurable in the form of rising global temperatures, especially at higher latitudes like ours.\n",

      "Brown smoke envelops Fort McMurray in 2016, as seen from the ground on May 6 and from NASA’s Aqua satellite on May 9. Jason Franson/The Canadian Press; NASA via Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "I started working on my latest book, Fire Weather, in 2016, just days after Fort McMurray disappeared beneath a fire-borne pyrocumulus cloud 14 kilometres tall. I did so not because this was a once-in-a-lifetime fire (the intervening years have proven otherwise). I did it because I understood, way back in 2016, that if a fire could do that much damage to such a wealthy, well-equipped subarctic city when the lakes were still frozen and car-sized blocks of ice still lined the Athabasca River, imagine what it could do to more southerly towns filled with old, densely packed wooden houses? Places such as Vancouver, Moose Jaw or St. John’s? Imagine what such a fire could do in cottage country, or in the thousands of rural communities located in the wildland urban interface, where half of Canadians, and a third of Americans, now live.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was scared, but I’m also angry: This situation was foreseen more than half a century ago, and it is now upon us with a vengeance. Wildfire seasons have been lengthening, and fires have been burning with a greater destructive intensity. I call it “21st-century fire” because that’s when fire really started to get weird. Before 2000, wildfire-generated pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms were an extreme rarity. Now they are a common feature; Alberta generated several of them in the first week of May alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, and elsewhere, wildfires have traditionally been viewed as a rural problem. But as we’ve seen in recent years in Australia, the United States, Canada – and many other places – cities and towns are increasingly under threat. The area of greatest concern to Canadians is the wildland urban interface – a.k.a. the WUI (rhymes with “phooey”). The WUI is where the forest meets the built environment, i.e., those tree-lined subdivisions where so many new Canadian homes are being built. It’s a beautiful place to live, until it’s on fire. The bad news is: Whether you live in the suburbs of Victoria, Saskatoon or Calgary, your neighbourhood is more flammable than it used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what else is different about 21st-century fire: In Fort McMurray on May 3, 2016, the temperature broke the record high for that date by 6 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity plummeted to 12 per cent – drier than Death Valley. For fire, that’s as good as gasoline. The Fort McMurray fire grew so big, so fast, it overran the city in an afternoon and generated its own stratospheric storm system in the middle of what had been a bluebird Alberta day. As the city’s residents made their frantic escape, it was through apocalyptic conditions that recalled the seventh plague in the Bible’s Book of Exodus: “So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land since Egypt became a nation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was none like it since Canada became a nation, either: The exodus of May 3 was the largest, most rapid displacement of people because of fire in modern times – anywhere on Earth. So profound was the damage, and so persistent were the flames (houses and work camps were still burning down two weeks later) that the city was closed for a full month. With the sole exception of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, no other North American city has been disinhabited for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few human beings alive have experienced what tens of thousands of our fellow citizens suddenly found themselves in the middle of on that blistering spring day. It was terrifying, and, as many survivors of the fire told me, hard to believe. Some things are just too big to fit in your head, and the Fort McMurray fire was one of those things. For some, it still is. A week into the fire, then-premier Rachel Notley tried to articulate the devastation she saw: “You go to a place where there was a house and what do you see on the ground? Nails. Piles and piles of nails.”\n",

      "In ancient times, the only things that could manifest this kind of annihilating End-Times energy were volcanoes, earthquakes and angry gods. Now, after two hundred years of relentless combustion, our fossil-fuel-driven civilization has become its own volcano.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I mean by that?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easier to wrap your head around the impact of a fire-powered civilization when you get past euphemisms such as “fossil fuels,” “coal” and “oil and gas,” and call our prime mover by its true name: fire. In this historical moment, fire is what drives us, what empowers us, what enables and enriches us, and it raises a burning question: Who is empowering whom? Fires are now burning where they’ve never burned before: Greenland, the High Arctic, and in rainforests from B.C. to Brazil. In 2021, even the International Energy Agency – historically, a friend to the fossil-fuel industry – said: Enough! If we are to maintain any semblance of climate stability, we must stop building fossil-fuel projects right now.\n",

      "If the IEA is freaked out, you know we’ve turned a corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire, and our slavish devotion to its force-multiplying power, lies at the root of our current situation. With our cars and stoves and central heating, hundreds of millions of us now live like emperors of old – only instead of enslaved people and draft animals serving us, we have fire-powered machines. Most Canadians command a vast invisible retinue. Just imagine how many horses it would take to move a two-ton minivan from Toronto to Ottawa at highway speed. Thanks to superb engineering, we remain blissfully unaware of the violent explosions taking place under the minivan’s hood with every turn of the crankshaft. Thanks to disingenuous advertising and lax laws, we are equally oblivious to the 100 kilograms of CO2 trailing behind us on that single Toronto-to-Ottawa run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billions of us are engaged in these activities. Lightning strikes the Earth millions of times a day, starting thousands of fires, but lightning’s got nothing on us. For starters, about three billion people are still cooking and heating with open fires. Meanwhile, in the developed world, you’ve got hundreds of millions of gas stoves, water heaters and home furnaces. The list of flammables goes on: Wars and trash generate a lot of fires; so does slash-and-burn agriculture, so do forest fires, and so does petroleum refining. According to the National Energy Board, Alberta’s bitumen industry uses more than 57,000,000 cubic metres (two billion cubic feet) of natural gas per day – the energy equivalent of 350,000 barrels of oil – for the sole purpose of separating bitumen from sand. Canada is the fifth-largest producer of natural gas in the world; in 2017, nearly a third of Canada’s total production was devoted to processing bitumen. Even after this colossal energy input, the rendered bitumen will still need further, fire-intensive upgrading to be actually burnable. Lest there be any confusion, natural gas is about 80 per cent methane, a greenhouse gas 50 times more potent than CO2.\n",

      "Already, we’re into the billions of daily human-caused fires, but it’s when I started looking at engines that the numbers really took off. Globally, you’ve got well over a billion cars, a quarter-billion trucks, 200 million motorcycles, 25,000 passenger jets, and 50,000 ocean-going freighters (a third of which are devoted to transporting more fuel to burn). A single six-cylinder minivan running at driving-to-school speed – 2,500 RPM – will generate around 10,000 combustions a minute, more than half a million per hour. That’s a lot of fires. Add them all up and you get tens of trillions of individual combustions. That, roughly speaking, is the number of fires humans make every day – uncountable as stars in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Nature: “Behold my mighty volcanoes and wildfires!” Humans: “Hold my beer.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "Every single one of those fires generates CO2 emissions, and all of it stays here on Earth (no, carbon capture will not make a dent in this). A certain amount is absorbed into limestone by chemical weathering, but the bulk of anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2 is absorbed by our oceans, or set loose in our atmosphere where it remains active for decades, if not centuries. Findings published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters revealed that, over the past 40 years, roughly 40 per cent of the area burned in wildfires in the western U.S. and southwestern Canada can be traced to industrial CO2 emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: When you extract, upgrade, refine and burn toxic substances such as coal, bitumen, oil and gas at the rate we are burning them, decade after decade, you’re going to see changes. Atmospheric CO2 levels are now fully 50 per cent higher than preindustrial times, and it affects everything we care about, from fetuses to phytoplankton, from water to winter. “Fire weather” is not just a book title, it’s a technical term. Natural Resources Canada uses a Fire Weather Index to gauge fire risk, and when the index is high, things we care about and depend on ignite much more easily. When Fort McMurray burned, the Fire Weather Index peaked at 42 – record territory, well beyond “Extreme.” In B.C., during the heat dome of 2021, it went far higher. Now, that was “unprecedented.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not unique to Canada; weather services around the world are scrambling to find new names and colours to account for these off-the-charts extremes in temperature, flammability, rainfall, ocean surge – you name it. It’s like the Spinal Tap amp that goes up to 11, only not funny: Australia’s new Fire Danger Ratings System goes from High to Extreme to Catastrophic.\n",

      "In this new, more combustible world that industrialized nations have imposed on all of us, Canada has a role to play, and culpability to own. These are challenging subjects for a major energy-producing (that is, fire-producing) country like ours.

More than 500 buildings were destroyed; two people died. “I’m 60,” said Lytton’s then-mayor, Jan Polderman, “and I thought climate change was a problem for the next generation.

If you were trapped in Nanaimo, B.C. on Monday this past long weekend, waiting to get a ride back to the mainland, the ferry lineup was anything but dull. Noticing how bored and frustrated their fellow travellers looked, the folks from Straight Up Racing got a bit mischievous, and deployed their robotic flaming dragon. Everyone was delighted. (Well, not so much the BC Ferries people.) Straight Up Racing operates out of Black Creek on Vancouver Island, and was on the road with their touring monster truck show. It’s an unwritten rule of monster truck shows that giant robot dragon-dinosaurs need to accompany the big-wheeled trucks, and it’s practically mandatory that said robo-saurs need to shoot flames in every direction. The Straight Up one is called Megasaurus, and it unfolds from a sort of tank-like trailer via hydraulics, complete with pincer claws and razor-sharp teeth.\n",

As it turns out, it was a harmless bit of fun that wrapped up just before the PA system started tut-tutting. Those that recorded the instance on their phones got a pretty good post for the ol’ social media. BC Ferries official spokespeople were quick to not-exactly-condemn the stunt, but did issue a gentle admonition. Citing safety as a number-one priority, a potential danger to passengers was noted. But the tone was more “Please don’t deploy your fire-breathing dragon again�? than any actual punishment. For the kids who saw Megasaurus make an impromptu cameo, the trip home got a little less dull. While we encourage safe travels for all your road-tripping this summer, should you happen to own a fire-breathing robot dinosaur, please deploy it at all possible opportunities. Clearly, it makes everything better.\n",

      "Bruce Linton was the founder and co-CEO of Canopy Growth, the first publicly traded cannabis company in North America. When weed first became legal in Canada, Bruce was riding the high. Under his leadership, Canopy grew into a company valued at around $18-billion. Bruce, in many ways, became the face of the cannabis boom. But things ended badly between Bruce and the company he created. Cannabis sales failed to meet the hype and in 2019, he was fired by the board. So what led to one of the most public business failures in recent memory? Bruce talks about how he got fired, why the cannabis sector hasn’t delivered on its colossal promise and what’s next for him.\n"

      "\n",
      "An out-of-control wildfire in suburban Halifax has burned several homes to their foundations and forced the evacuation of more than 16,000 residents, triggering one of the largest fire responses in Nova Scotia’s history.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 24 hours after the blaze began, the vast majority of evacuees in the communities of Upper Tantallon, Pockwock and Hammonds Plains did not know if they would have homes to return to.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unusually dry spring has combined with high wind speeds over the past few days to spread the fire – it now covers 788 hectares – and make it exceedingly difficult to control. Crews in helicopters and water bombers spent much of Monday trying to extinguish the flames, but continuing high winds made their work challenging, Halifax Mayor Mike Savage said during an afternoon press conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Premier Tim Houston, speaking to reporters, said “dozens of structures” were lost during the fire, or sustained significant damage. He said it was difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the losses because wind and smoke were limiting visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right now, with the intensity of these fires, the resources are completely focused on tamping them back,” he said. “The safety of our firefighters is the number one priority.” No deaths or injuries have been reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Premier said the evacuation orders for affected communities would be in place for at least a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Nick Horne and his family evacuated their home Sunday afternoon, he didn’t have time to grab anything aside from his phone charger. Mr. Horne has lived in Westwood Hills, the subdivision where the fire originated, since 2008. Even before the emergency alerts went out, he knew his family had to leave quickly, because there is only one safe way out of the community: Westwood Boulevard.\n",
      "\n",
      "As his car inched down Westwood in a queue of about 200 other vehicles, Mr. Horne could see flames that were almost 50 metres tall, just about 80 metres from the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I saw the first houses that were no longer there as we drove by them, my heart left my body,” he said. His family is staying with relatives in Beaver Bank, about 40 kilometres away. They have no idea when they might be able to return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Horne said he had received unofficial word that as of Monday afternoon his home had not been touched by the fire. But others have begun learning that their houses have been completely destroyed. Online communities have formed where those who were away when the evacuation order went out are posting desperate pleas for assistance in rescuing pets that were left behind.\n",

      "Open this photo in gallery: Firefighters prepare to load gear at a command centre within the evacuated zone of the wildfire burning in Tantallon, N.S., outside of Halifax on May 29.Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press\n",
      "\n",
      "Residents fleeing the area along Hammonds Plains Road, a major artery that connects Upper Tantallon with the communities east of it, which were evacuated as the fire spread, shared gripping footage on Sunday and Monday of the dangerous conditions they drove through. Tall orange flames bordered the road, smoke reduced visibility to almost nothing, and embers and ash rained down from the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Betty Hannam and her husband, Bernard Crilley, who live about 14 kilometres from Mr. Horne, received an evacuation order late Sunday night. By that point most others had already fled the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Crilley suffers from severe allergies to dogs, so their options for overnight stays were limited. They had lost their power and internet connection, leaving them with little information about the scale of the fire and emergency response. They packed some clothes and a safe that contains some important items, then started driving in search of a hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "After driving all over the municipality and being turned away at multiple hotels that were already full of other evacuees, at 1:30 a.m. they finally arrived at the Canada Games Centre, a short drive from downtown Halifax. The sports facility had been transformed into an emergency shelter operated by the Canadian Red Cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two dozen cots were set up in a large gymnasium, and the couple were among the 15 people who claimed them Sunday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after a rough slumber – Ms. Hannam suffers from sciatic nerve pain, and in the rush of evacuation had forgotten her medication at home – the couple vowed to spend Monday night in their car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last time the Canadian Red Cross had to mobilize this way in Nova Scotia was during Hurricane Fiona last fall, said Ancel Langille, a senior manager for emergency management with the organization. But in that case, he said, most had a few days’ warning the storm was coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the wildfire, “some people had to leave at a moment’s notice,” Mr. Langille added. “It was very fast and some people don’t have medications, and people don’t have clothing, so we’re doing our best to support them with helping to meet some basic needs.”\n"

      "Jesse Winter is an award-winning visual journalist based in Vancouver. For this week’s deeper dive, he talks about photographing the prescribed burn at ?aq’am First Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The jet-engine roar of trees torching in a forest fire is something you feel more than you hear. It’s terrifying, exhilarating and beautiful all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early May, I watched through my camera’s viewfinder as tree after tree caught light on the ?aq’am First Nation’s reserve lands outside Cranbrook, B.C. It was a 1,200 hectare controlled fire in partnership with the City of Cranbrook and supported by the B.C. Wildfire Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearby, a team of B.C.W.S. firefighters were refilling their drip torches. As the exploding trees grew nearer, they casually picked up their open torches (filled with a mixture of diesel fuel and gasoline) and shuffled back a few metres into the lee of a white forest service pickup truck. They chatted as they refuelled themselves along with their torches, then went back to setting the rest of the forest on fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many ways, the scene felt evocative of our broader relationship with forest fires. Since colonization, the prevailing beliefs about wildfire painted it as a horrifying monster, something to be corralled, controlled and ultimately vanquished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is that in many fire-prone parts of Canada, it’s something we have to live alongside, a necessary reset to ecosystems that evolved to rely on fire. For millennia, Indigenous communities in Canada have known this, and used fire expertly to help keep forests healthy despite settler’s attempts to stamp out the practice.\n",

      "Now, as Wendy Stueck reports, Indigenous communities like ?aq’am are leading efforts to bring healthy fire back to landscapes that — in the age of climate change — desperately need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching the B.C.W.S. crews work the controlled burn alongside members of the Ktunaxa Nation and the Cranbrook fire department, I was struck by how much most of us still have to learn about fire: how it moves on the landscape, how it can be helpful, how it only becomes something to fear if we first refuse to respect it. The more Canadians understand wildfire, the better prepared we’ll be to live with it and, when necessary, stay safe from it. I hope these pictures and Wendy’s words can help build that understanding.\n",

      "\n",
      "An unusually dry spring has combined with high wind speeds over the past few days to spread the fire – it now covers 788 hectares – and make it exceedingly difficult to control. Crews in helicopters and water bombers spent much of Monday trying to extinguish the flames, but continuing high winds made their work challenging, Halifax Mayor Mike Savage said during an afternoon press conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Premier Tim Houston, speaking to reporters, said “dozens of structures” were lost during the fire, or sustained significant damage. He said it was difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the losses because wind and smoke were limiting visibility.\n",

      "As his car inched down Westwood in a queue of about 200 other vehicles, Mr. Horne could see flames that were almost 50 metres tall, just about 80 metres from the road.\n",

      "“When I saw the first houses that were no longer there as we drove by them, my heart left my body,” he said. His family is staying with relatives in Beaver Bank, about 40 kilometres away. They have no idea when they might be able to return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Horne said he had received unofficial word that as of Monday afternoon his home had not been touched by the fire. But others have begun learning that their houses have been completely destroyed. Online communities have formed where those who were away when the evacuation order went out are posting desperate pleas for assistance in rescuing pets that were left behind.\n",

      "Residents fleeing the area along Hammonds Plains Road, a major artery that connects Upper Tantallon with the communities east of it, which were evacuated as the fire spread, shared gripping footage on Sunday and Monday of the dangerous conditions they drove through. Tall orange flames bordered the road, smoke reduced visibility to almost nothing, and embers and ash rained down from the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Betty Hannam and her husband, Bernard Crilley, who live about 14 kilometres from Mr. Horne, received an evacuation order late Sunday night. By that point most others had already fled the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Crilley suffers from severe allergies to dogs, so their options for overnight stays were limited. They had lost their power and internet connection, leaving them with little information about the scale of the fire and emergency response. They packed some clothes and a safe that contains some important items, then started driving in search of a hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "After driving all over the municipality and being turned away at multiple hotels that were already full of other evacuees, at 1:30 a.m. they finally arrived at the Canada Games Centre, a short drive from downtown Halifax. The sports facility had been transformed into an emergency shelter operated by the Canadian Red Cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two dozen cots were set up in a large gymnasium, and the couple were among the 15 people who claimed them Sunday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after a rough slumber – Ms. Hannam suffers from sciatic nerve pain, and in the rush of evacuation had forgotten her medication at home – the couple vowed to spend Monday night in their car.\n",

      "\n",
      "With the wildfire, “some people had to leave at a moment’s notice,” Mr. Langille added. “It was very fast and some people don’t have medications, and people don’t have clothing, so we’re doing our best to support them with helping to meet some basic needs.”\n"

      "Residents fleeing the area along Hammonds Plains Road, a major artery that connects Upper Tantallon with the communities east of it, which were evacuated as the fire spread, shared gripping footage on Sunday and Monday of the dangerous conditions they drove through. Tall orange flames bordered the road, smoke reduced visibility to almost nothing, and embers and ash rained down from the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Betty Hannam and her husband, Bernard Crilley, who live about 14 kilometres from Mr. Horne, received an evacuation order late Sunday night. By that point most others had already fled the area.\n",

      "Mr. Crilley suffers from severe allergies to dogs, so their options for overnight stays were limited. They had lost their power and internet connection, leaving them with little information about the scale of the fire and emergency response. They packed some clothes and a safe that contains some important items, then started driving in search of a hotel.\n",

      "After driving all over the municipality and being turned away at multiple hotels that were already full of other evacuees, at 1:30 a.m. they finally arrived at the Canada Games Centre, a short drive from downtown Halifax. The sports facility had been transformed into an emergency shelter operated by the Canadian Red Cross.\n",

      "About two dozen cots were set up in a large gymnasium, and the couple were among the 15 people who claimed them Sunday night.\n",

      "The last time the Canadian Red Cross had to mobilize this way in Nova Scotia was during Hurricane Fiona last fall, said Ancel Langille, a senior manager for emergency management with the organization. But in that case, he said, most had a few days’ warning the storm was coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the wildfire, “some people had to leave at a moment’s notice,” Mr. Langille added. “It was very fast and some people don’t have medications, and people don’t have clothing, so we’re doing our best to support them with helping to meet some basic needs.”\n"

      "A rapidly moving wildfire that officials say is the worst they have ever seen remains out of control in the Halifax area, burning about 200 homes and buildings as more than 16,000 people remain evacuated from the wooded suburban community of Tantallon.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 120 firefighters and three helicopters are working to contain the blaze and protect homes in an area covering roughly 788 hectares, and the intensity isn’t expected to let up, provincial and municipal fire officials said Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We know that today could be a challenging day,” said Halifax fire deputy chief Dave Meldrum on Tuesday morning. “There will be a change in the weather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Winds are expected to gust up to 30 kilometres an hour throughout today so the fire may spread further this afternoon, increasing the risk to firefighters on the ground. Fire crews are focused on protecting houses and other structures, reinforcing fire perimeters and specific areas of concern, such as hotspots.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smoke has engulfed some of the surrounding communities and across the city since Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Smoke is definitely a stressor,” Mr. Meldrum said. “It’s advisable to remain indoors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the speed of the fire and the ability of firefighters to get resources on its flanks was the biggest challenge when the fire first spread out of control on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This doesn’t mean that we don’t need adequate supplies of firefighting water in our communities,” he said in response to questions that have surfaced after the Halifax Examiner published a 2021 Auditor-General’s report that found city-wide shortcomings in the planning and development of water sources for firefighting in subdivisions. “It simply means that the speed of this fire was the greatest dynamic and the intensity of this fire was so serious that our firefighters could not work in the front or the head of the fire for their own safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was an extreme event and unseen before for many, many of us but it is very important that community planning consider emergency access and egress and we work with our planning folks and developers in our municipality and talk about communities and what communities will look like in the coming years,” Mr. Meldrum said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Auditor-General’s report said Halifax fire managers had warned the city that three of the subdivisions which have been evacuated in Tantallon were “built without appropriate fire safety specifications, such as inadequate water sources to fight fires.” Those subdivisions are Westwood Hills in Upper Tantallon, White Hills in Hammonds Plains and Indigo Shores.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s unclear what Halifax Regional Municipality has done to rectify the situation. The city is expected to provide a response Tuesday.\n",

      "Meanwhile, Mr. Meldrum said, firefighters are run off their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is going to be a tough week for us. ... They’re tired,” he said, adding that there are firefighters and first responders who have been personally affected by the wildfires.\n"

      "The study, published last year in the Lancet Regional Health Americas and also involving researchers from Brazil, Denmark and the United States, estimated the southern region of Brazil had a nearly 19 per cent increase in low birth weightdue to wildfire smoke exposure in the first trimester.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers studied 1.6 million birth records from across Brazil between 2001 and 2018, and analyzed wildfire smoke that occurred throughout that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, that study contradicts findings in other research, including by retired but still active McGill University psychiatry professor Suzanne King after multiple natural disasters such as the 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alta., and the 1998 ice storm in Quebec, where millions of people were left without electricity, some for over a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We really wanted to find something but we found no effect, not even when we tried to estimate the number of days without electricity, no effect whatsoever,” King said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, pregnant people should not blame themselves for whatever is out of their control, she said of behaviour or physical issues of children born during or after a wildfire or other disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there’s an effect on the kid, it’s probably more because your house burned down than that you were upset because your house burned down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. David Olson, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Alberta, led a study into the emotional stresses that pregnant people faced during the May 2016 wildfire evacuation in Fort McMurray.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said about 80 per cent of about 300 participants said the evacuation was not their worst experience but it triggered other trauma they’d suffered, such as abuse or the death of a spouse or child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pregnant women who go through a disaster like this can certainly use support,” he said, adding that officials who operate evacuation centres should ensure pregnant people remain with their families and have the support of friends and a social worker if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said pregnant people who were forced to leave their homes as flames neared faced an accumulation of stress that led to anxiety and depression for some, especially those with a history of trauma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public health officials will need to put more emphasis on dealing with mental health issues, not just the physical problems that come from smoke during wildfires, which are bound to increase due to climate change, Olson said.\n",

Oliver Santiago, the man he assaulted, wholeheartedly agrees. “When an officer abuses their power and engages in criminal behaviour, it not only undermines the integrity of the law enforcement profession but also erodes public trust and confidence,” he told the disciplinary hearing. On sick leave since 2020, Holmes also concedes his behaviour was “terrible” and he should never wear the uniform again. But he blames his misconduct on PTSD he acquired on the job and wants to be demoted — not fired — so TPS can continue to top up the disability he receives from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.\n",

      "\n",
      "Firefighters continued to battle a growing blaze in the Halifax area Wednesday, as gusting winds and more dry weather are expected to worsen the raging wildfire that has already burned at least 150 homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a site of tragedy. There’s widespread destruction and, at the same time, there’s a level of randomness that comes with wildfires,” Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency Deputy Chief Dave Meldrum said at a morning news conference. “There are properties that are unharmed in close proximity to properties that are destroyed. It’s terrible to see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Meldrum warned the public to be ready for a long firefight. “We’ve got a lot of dry weather days ahead. We’ve got low humidities forecasted,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wildfire has spread to cover 837 hectares in the wooded suburban communities west of Halifax. More than 16,000 people from Tantallon and Hammonds Plains remain under evacuation orders. Wooded city parks are closed. And the province has banned any recreational activity in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provincial and municipal officials amped up resources Wednesday to battle the out of control wildfire, dispatching eight fire engines, 14 fire tankers, two Department of National Defence brush trucks, and about 100 firefighters. Prince Edward Island has sent six firefighters to the area to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a very dangerous situation. It’s changing every moment, with wind, with fuels, with the lay of the land, how the sun is heating fuels – everything is constantly evolving,” said Dave Steeves, a forester with the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, a much larger uncontained fire in southwestern Nova Scotia has forced 2,000 people to leave their homes since the fire started on the weekend in Shelburne County.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of Wednesday, the fire northwest of Barrington, N.S., had grown to almost 200 square kilometres, making it one of largest wildfires ever recorded in the province. A third out-of-control fire is burning near East Pubnico in southwestern Nova Scotia at only one square kilometre, but is expected to grow.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that as of Friday afternoon there were 324 fires burning across the country, and 167 are considered out of control. That includes the Tantallon fire in Halifax that has destroyed or damaged 151 homes so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s a big jump from Thursday, when the agency reported 209 fires, with 87 out of control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said Friday that cooler weather is expected in Western Canada and rain in Nova Scotia, which will help. But the severe fire warnings are likely to continue in most provinces for another four to five weeks at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The situation remains severe across the country,” Blair said. “We are hopeful that the improving weather conditions and that rain will assist in the firefighting efforts, but there’s still a great deal of work that needs to be done.”\n",

      "More than 27,000 square kilometres of land has burned in Canada over the last two months, more than 10 times the average amount of land burned by fires over the last decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far, more than 96 per cent of the burned land was in Western Canada and Northwest Territories, but last weekend the situation became more severe in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and now parts of Ontario and Quebec are also burning.\n",

      "The number of fires, their size and severity, as well as the number of places affected are straining Canada’s resources, so the Canada Interagency Forest Fire Centre has requested help from international partners.\n",

      "The South African High Commission in Ottawa said Friday 200 firefighters and 15 managers would leave South Africa Saturday, and they are heading to Alberta for 35 days. Another 200 firefighters and 13 managers are set to follow on June 10.\n",

      "\n",
      "South Africa’s aid hasn’t been without controversy in the past. In 2016, 300 firefighters flew to Fort McMurray to help with the major blaze that forced the evacuation of the city, but a month-long deployment lasted less than two weeks in a dispute over pay.\n",

      "While the fire service prefers to respond to alarms instead of sounding them, there is an urgent need to bring attention to the state of fire and emergency services in Canada. This country is relying heavily on a volunteer fire service that is seriously overburdened during wildfire season and during the rest of the year. Training and equipment have fallen behind the times. We are adapting to climate change too slowly. The issues are predictable and the situation is unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s needed isn’t new, but it is more urgent. The wildfire season is now starting earlier. Hot and dry conditions could expand the risk from wildfires into new areas. The fires are now spread out across multiple communities and provinces, limiting the interprovincial sharing of resources. Communities are built further into forested areas, and where once provincial wildfire agencies handled these incidents, they are now calling on firefighters from local fire departments to help. Most of these are volunteer firefighters, who are also needed in other emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can be done? Canada needs to stop the hemorrhaging of volunteer firefighters by sending a clear message: they are needed, recognized and appreciated. The Canadian military and international firefighters are important, but our 90,000 volunteer firefighters are the backbone of fire and emergency services in their communities. Increasing the volunteer firefighter and search and rescue tax credits from $3,000 to $10,000 would help. Costed by the Parliamentary Budget Officer at $171-million over five years, the price tag is far less than the billions needed to replace volunteer firefighters with career firefighters, not to mention fire losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to restore our cache of equipment. Consider that the International Agency for Research on Cancer reclassified firefighting as a top tier carcinogenic profession. We can’t have firefighters without the right protection. In 2013, a Public Safety Canada memo stated that it was sunsetting the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program, which covered training and equipment, because needs had been met. This is no longer true. This program needs to be brought back, as more than 40 per cent of fire departments have deferred training and equipment purchases because of budgetary constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given fire seasons are starting earlier, we need to get an earlier start on next year’s preparations. Canadians need to know how to protect their homes. A starting point is removing unnecessary materials that catch fire, from old leaves to exposed recycling bins. A comprehensive approach to risk reduction is available through resources such as Firesmart Canada to help communities increase wildfire resilience, but it has costs. Fire departments need the resources to educate communities and help Canadians get the job done. Builders, developers and insurers need incentives toward climate and fire safety considerations. Indigenous wildfire management practices need to be integrated into Western wildfire practices: They have been used effectively for generations and Indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal and provincial funding is needed to properly train all volunteer and career firefighters who reside in Indigenous, municipal and local fire departments in a manner that ensures interoperability with provincial agencies. This will ensure that firefighters are available for rapid deployment when needed for the appropriate length of time and that the individuals trained remain active in the fire service when not required. Regular training and proper staffing are key to protecting physical and mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, all levels of government must co-ordinate. Currently, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre works across provinces and links to Natural Resources Canada. What’s missing are the municipalities, Indigenous communities, and the technically specialized Heavy Urban Search and Rescue teams. We need expanded interagency agreements bringing all stakeholders to the table. We owe this to each other, firefighters, and their families and community members, who are doing their best to follow directions and support one another. If we do all these things this year, we’ll be in a much stronger position to face next year’s fires.\n"

      "She has two main pieces of advice to new renters to avoid being exploited. First, she says people need to be aware that rental units built after 2018 are not rent-controlled, meaning landlords can hike the rent by massive amounts. People can avoid these units to avoid nasty surprises down the road, she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her second tip is never to prepay rent. It’s illegal for landlords to ask for this, but legal for a tenant to offer. International students will often offer to prepay to beat competitors on the advice of an agent, but may later find that their apartment is much worse than advertised. Tenants in this scenario would have a hard time getting a refund for these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Geddie also says it’s common for landlords to renovate a place simply to force a tenant to vacate. But tenants aren’t always aware that they have the right to move back in after the renovation is complete. If that’s what tenants want to do, they must write to their landlord before leaving the unit saying they intend to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quebec\n",
      "\n",
      "Quebec has long been seen as a haven for cheap rent, but Arnold Bennett, director of the advocacy group Housing Hotline, says rents have increased greatly during the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennett says Quebec has strong tenant rights for one group in particular: low-income seniors. People who fit into this category and who have been living in their rental for more than 10 years cannot have their house repossessed by a landlord for personal use.\n",
      "\n",
      "And similar to Ontario, tenants have a right to return if their landlord forces them to vacate a rental for large renovations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One unique part of rental life in Quebec is that contracts generally end on July 1 (this used to be mandated). Today, many contracts still follow this schedule, and chaos ensues each year on Canada Day, especially on the streets of Montreal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennett warns those new to Quebec who have a July 1 moving date to remember that it’s a national holiday, so many stores will be closed and movers will generally charge double the usual rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "British Columbia\n",
      "\n",
      "Megan Tweedie, a lawyer with Access Pro Bono Society of British Columbia, says one of the most common ways to end a tenancy in the province is for a landlord to give their tenant two-month’s notice that they intend to use the space for personal reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she says many renters aren’t aware that in this scenario they are almost always entitled to be paid a full month’s rent by the landlord. This will especially help in the search given the current rental environment in B.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Tweedie says people who suspect that their landlord is lying about their personal-use claim can also dispute it within 15 days by filing online. By doing so, the renter can continue living in their home until they get a hearing with the province’s landlord and tenant board, which can take months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta\n",
      "\n",
      "The housing market in Alberta has remained relatively stagnant compared with other parts of the country, and rents have remained low as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, University of Alberta associate professor Anna Lund says the province’s housing laws generally skew in favour of landlords. For example, Alberta doesn’t have any sort of standard rent-control rules, except that landlords can only increase rent once a year. However, that increase can be as high as they like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta does share some standard tenant rights with other provinces, such as protections against human rights discrimination and the abatement of rent if the premises aren’t delivering on promises from the landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, she says the fact that 82 per cent of applications to Alberta’s landlord and tenant board are by landlords shows there is sense among most renters that there’s no point in waging a fight when they feel wronged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manitoba\n",
      "\n",
      "Allison Fenske, a lawyer with the Public Interest Law Centre, says there’s a growing trend for landlords at larger buildings to charge higher fees than normal if an apartment isn’t left spotless when a tenant moves out. But she says people don’t realize that’s illegal and those fees can be fought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charges cannot be punitive in nature and must only reflect the actual cost of a service, Ms. Fenske says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term tenants should also be aware that landlords are required to make certain cosmetic updates for regular wear and tear once a tenant has lived in a space for roughly five to seven years, she says. This can include a fresh coat of paint or a new carpet.\n",

      "\n",
      "Heavy rain and some military reinforcements arrived to assist efforts on Saturday to quell the wildfires that have destroyed homes and caused the evacuation of thousands of people across Nova Scotia.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major Halifax-area wildfire that has destroyed 150 homes was 85 per cent contained and no longer spreading, officials said Saturday. The news was also good across the province, where Premier Tim Houston said the total number of active wildfires declined from 10 in the morning to five by mid-afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you step outside you will see something beautiful: rain, and hopefully lots of it,” he told an afternoon briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only fire that remains out of control is one in Shelburne County in the southwestern corner of the province – the largest in Nova Scotia’s history – which remains “scary,” Houston said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, at the provincial wildfire centre in Shubenacadie, north of Halifax, about 20 Canadian Armed Forces soldiers stood in the pouring rain outside a light armoured vehicle, or LAV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lt.-Col. Michael Blanchette said the initial contingent from CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick had arrived on a “fact-finding mission” to see what military support was needed in the effort to combat the fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the armoured vehicle has a thermal sight system that might be able to detect hidden hot spots, especially at night, while soldiers can provide “low-level firefighting capability” such as stamping out smaller hot spots after firefighters have gone through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blanchette said military members in Atlantic Canada are used to being called in for floods and winter storms, but he’s never before responded to a wildfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the first time for us,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Steeves, a technician of forest resources with Nova Scotia’s Department of Natural Resources and Renewables, told reporters Saturday morning the Halifax-area fire was sitting at 9.5 square kilometres and is unlikely to grow due to a combination of firefighting efforts and long-awaited rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are moving from a state of out of control to a state of being held,” he said. “And basically what that means is that, with the current resources that we have on site and with the suppression efforts that have taken place, the fire is not likely to spread.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Steeves said a number of areas of concern remain and crews continue to closely monitor hot spots around the fire’s perimeter. He warned the blaze was far from out and embers could still hide deep in places where the rain doesn’t penetrate, causing a risk of reignition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We could be here for weeks, we could be here for a couple of months before the incident commander is comfortable in saying this fire is out,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wildfire that broke out Sunday in the Halifax area raced through a number of subdivisions, consuming about 200 structures – including 151 homes – and forcing the evacuation of more than 16,000 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada Meteorologist Bob Robichaud said between 25 and 50 millimetres of rain had fallen in parts of the province on Saturday, adding temperatures had also cooled. He said air quality across most of the affected areas had also greatly improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency Deputy Fire Chief Dave Meldrum said Saturday morning that the rain has brought relief, but also raises the risk that firefighters could be hurt from slips or falls and makes for difficult working conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’re going to be very very dirty, they’re going to be wet, they’re going to be cold,” he said of the firefighters. “So we welcome this rain but it’s going to be a tough working day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said there were two reported injuries related to heat stress so far, and one firefighter bumped their head while moving equipment, but nobody has been seriously hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he’d said it was unclear when the thousands of evacuated residents would be allowed to go home, an evacuation order was lifted on Friday for some Halifax-area residents living on parts of Lucasville Rd, as well as parts of the St. George’s Blvd and the Stillwell Lake area.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Shelburne County, meanwhile, 6,700 people – about half the municipality’s population – remained out of their homes as the blaze that forced their evacuation continued to burn out of control\n",
      "\n",
      "The Barrington Lake wildfire, which started Saturday, reached 230 square kilometres – the largest recorded wildfire in the province’s history. It has consumed at least 50 homes and cottages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave Rockwood, a spokesman for the Department of Natural Resources, said there was “cautious optimism” that there would be no further growth and that firefighters could use more direct tactics to contain it. Two other fires considered out of control as of Saturday morning were classified as “held” later in the day, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Houston confirmed that schools in Shelburne County would be closed Monday and Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "A contingent of 17 firefighters from the northeastern United States were expected to arrive at the wildfire centre later Saturday, before being deployed to help the firefighting efforts.\n"

      "In the video, Mr. Adam points out buildings that are so far untouched by the fire, including homes, a school and a nursing station.

      "“This whole area will have sprinklers, and if anything comes, they will feed it with the fire hydrant,” Mr. Adams said in the video.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Fort Chipewyan and other communities in the wildland-urban interface, or WUI – the area where human development meets the forest – such efforts can make a difference between devastation and survival. Officials in Logan Lake, B.C., for example, credit sprinklers for helping the community fend off a wildfire in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "As wildfires force thousands to flee their homes in Alberta and Nova Scotia – where fires have been burning since late May – questions of how to manage wildfire risk in WUI terrain loom large. Mapping and analyzing WUI territory would be helpful, but efforts to do that at a national level are still relatively new.\n",
      "\n",
      "And although there may be consensus on how best to protect communities from wildfire risk – a joint federal, provincial and territorial vision statement for a Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy was released in 2006 – that strategy hasn’t been fully rolled out, partly owing to its multi-jurisdictional nature and its high cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a country, we have a national plan on how to get ready for wildfires and how to manage and minimize the risk going forward,” says Paul Kovacs, executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, a non-profit group that focuses on disaster prevention and research. “What we don’t have is a plan that has been implemented and funded.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There are national programs. In 1982, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre was set up so that jurisdictions could share personnel, aircraft and equipment among themselves and with international partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "FireSmart Canada, a program meant to help communities protect themselves from damaging impacts of wildfires, dates back to 1990, when a committee was set up to address common concerns about wildfires in WUI terrain. Scores of FireSmart programs have been rolled out throughout the country in areas such as fuel management (clearing brush around WUI communities) or public education.\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite those programs, experts say there’s not a comprehensive enough strategy backed by sufficient funds to tackle the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: The Abasands neighbourhood of Fort McMurray, Alta. was decimated by wildfire in May 2016. The Fort McMurray fires resulted in billions of dollars’ worth of damage.The Canadian Press\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, a group made of up federal, provincial and territorial forestry ministers, released a report that reviewed the previous decade’s efforts to roll out the Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy, saying that while some progress had been made, actions had been “somewhat ad hoc” and that a lack of standardized reporting made it difficult to track progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that void, many jurisdictions have taken their own steps to tackle wildfire risk, Mr. Kovacs says, particularly in B.C. and Alberta, where large wildfires – as in Kelowna in 2003 and in Fort McMurray in 2016 – resulted in billions of dollars’ worth of damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildland fire ecologist Robert Gray, based in Chilliwack, B.C., says B.C.’s FireSmart grant program can be difficult to navigate and puts smaller communities, especially Indigenous communities, at a disadvantage compared with larger centres that have greater capacity to apply for grants and hire personnel to administer programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the grant program isn’t operating at the scale required to make a dent in wildfire prevention, he says, noting that it took two years to cobble together funds – about $180,000 – to carry out a 79-hectare prescribed burn at the Canadian Rockies International Airport in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress is happening, albeit not as quickly or efficiently as many would like. In 2021, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers endorsed a five-year action plan to implement the previously-announced national wildfire strategy, noting that Canada now “regularly experiences large, catastrophic wildland fire events.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in 2022, B.C. announced wildfire funding that would, among other things, allow the B.C. Wildfire Service to run year-round. On June 1, as part of an update on wildfire programs, federal officials announced Ottawa had signed agreements to train 300 Indigenous firefighters and 125 Indigenous fire guardians this season.\n",

      "\n",
      "In reviewing community wildfire protection plans introduced over the past decade in B.C. and Alberta, Mr. Kovacs has seen two hurdles that keep those plans from being fully implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is money – it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to thin and prune nearby forests, for example – and the second is the debate over whether fire-mitigation measures should be required or recommended, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the question of how to limit expansion into WUI areas is a prickly one, with growing populations and people’s desire to live close to wooded areas bumping up against wildfire threats. In a 2018 ICLR report, Mr. Kovacs looked at how local governments could use development permits to require certain fire-resistant building materials and “to control and even prohibit” residential development in areas of high wildfire risk. In that report, he said “more than a dozen” communities in B.C. and Alberta had begun to use development permits to control residential development in WUI areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s currently working on an update, but doesn’t expect to see a big jump in the number of communities taking that approach, saying it remains relatively rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kovacs would like to see a firm funding commitment for a national wildfire strategy, as well as clarity on how goals are to be met.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you encourage outcomes that are better than we are experiencing right now – if it’s not through regulation, how do you get there? And that is an important political conversation,” he adds.\n",

      "Canada has a data gap in its tracking of wildfire risk for vulnerable communities\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike geographical features like floodplains, the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) arises largely from people’s choices. As Canadians build more houses amid wildland vegetation, wildfires in those areas become more consequential: they destroy more things we care about. The likelihood of ignition also increases, because people cause about half of Canada’s wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be advantageous, then, to know where Canada’s WUI (pronounced “woo-ee”) is expanding, and how rapidly. But we don’t. We also don’t have tools for assessing wildfire risk like we have for flooding and earthquakes. We even lack crucial data inputs, such as high-resolution maps of vegetation and other fire fuels, or detailed records about fires over a sufficiently long time period to capture the variability of fire regimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "These data gaps impede our ability to take full advantage of the fact that there are plenty of effective strategies for reducing risk. Homeowners in the WUI can change roofing, siding and ventilation. Municipalities can regulate land use planning in the WUI to prevent expansion into high-risk areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just as there’s so many overwhelming problems, there’s just as many options for helping and mitigating risk, or adapting to fire on the landscape,” said Lynn Johnston, a fire scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Johnston is among the researchers who are tackling the blind spots. Until 2016, nobody could say where the WUI began and ended. She mapped it while completing her Master’s degree at the University of Alberta. That exercise revealed 32.3 million hectares of WUI, representing 3.8 per cent of Canada’s total land mass. Since then, British Columbia created and updated maps depicting at-risk areas within its WUI.\n",
      "\n",
      "American researchers fret about their own data gaps, although they’re generally ahead of us. In 2018, one group mapped decadal changes in the U.S. WUI between 1990 and 2010 within census blocks and discovered that over that time, it had grown by 189,000 square kilometres, an area larger than Washington State.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As long as WUI growth is unchecked, wildfire problems will likely worsen,” they warned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. is also further along in developing formal methods of assessing wildfire risks. But Ms. Johnston said the Canada Forest Service, provincial fire managers and certain universities, are pressing forward. And many crucial inputs for assessing fire risk, such as the locations of buildings and climate models, already exist and are evolving rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We really need to start mapping these things,” she said.\n",

There was heavy smoke throughout the town and forest fire prevention teams were doing trenchwork in the area to protect it. Residents were relocated to Senneterre, about 90 kilometres south of the community.\n",

      "While the fire service prefers to respond to alarms instead of sounding them, there is an urgent need to bring attention to the state of fire and emergency services in Canada. This country is relying heavily on a volunteer fire service that is seriously overburdened during wildfire season and during the rest of the year. Training and equipment have fallen behind the times. We are adapting to climate change too slowly. The issues are predictable and the situation is unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s needed isn’t new, but it is more urgent. The wildfire season is now starting earlier. Hot and dry conditions could expand the risk from wildfires into new areas. The fires are now spread out across multiple communities and provinces, limiting the interprovincial sharing of resources. Communities are built further into forested areas, and where once provincial wildfire agencies handled these incidents, they are now calling on firefighters from local fire departments to help. Most of these are volunteer firefighters, who are also needed in other emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can be done? Canada needs to stop the hemorrhaging of volunteer firefighters by sending a clear message: they are needed, recognized and appreciated. The Canadian military and international firefighters are important, but our 90,000 volunteer firefighters are the backbone of fire and emergency services in their communities. Increasing the volunteer firefighter and search and rescue tax credits from $3,000 to $10,000 would help. Costed by the Parliamentary Budget Officer at $171-million over five years, the price tag is far less than the billions needed to replace volunteer firefighters with career firefighters, not to mention fire losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to restore our cache of equipment. Consider that the International Agency for Research on Cancer reclassified firefighting as a top tier carcinogenic profession. We can’t have firefighters without the right protection. In 2013, a Public Safety Canada memo stated that it was sunsetting the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program, which covered training and equipment, because needs had been met. This is no longer true. This program needs to be brought back, as more than 40 per cent of fire departments have deferred training and equipment purchases because of budgetary constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given fire seasons are starting earlier, we need to get an earlier start on next year’s preparations. Canadians need to know how to protect their homes. A starting point is removing unnecessary materials that catch fire, from old leaves to exposed recycling bins. A comprehensive approach to risk reduction is available through resources such as Firesmart Canada to help communities increase wildfire resilience, but it has costs. Fire departments need the resources to educate communities and help Canadians get the job done. Builders, developers and insurers need incentives toward climate and fire safety considerations. Indigenous wildfire management practices need to be integrated into Western wildfire practices: They have been used effectively for generations and Indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal and provincial funding is needed to properly train all volunteer and career firefighters who reside in Indigenous, municipal and local fire departments in a manner that ensures interoperability with provincial agencies. This will ensure that firefighters are available for rapid deployment when needed for the appropriate length of time and that the individuals trained remain active in the fire service when not required. Regular training and proper staffing are key to protecting physical and mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, all levels of government must co-ordinate. Currently, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre works across provinces and links to Natural Resources Canada. What’s missing are the municipalities, Indigenous communities, and the technically specialized Heavy Urban Search and Rescue teams. We need expanded interagency agreements bringing all stakeholders to the table. We owe this to each other, firefighters, and their families and community members, who are doing their best to follow directions and support one another. If we do all these things this year, we’ll be in a much stronger position to face next year’s fires.\n"

      "In the video, Mr. Adam points out buildings that are so far untouched by the fire, including homes, a school and a nursing station.

      "“This whole area will have sprinklers, and if anything comes, they will feed it with the fire hydrant,” Mr. Adams said in the video.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Fort Chipewyan and other communities in the wildland-urban interface, or WUI – the area where human development meets the forest – such efforts can make a difference between devastation and survival. Officials in Logan Lake, B.C., for example, credit sprinklers for helping the community fend off a wildfire in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "As wildfires force thousands to flee their homes in Alberta and Nova Scotia – where fires have been burning since late May – questions of how to manage wildfire risk in WUI terrain loom large. Mapping and analyzing WUI territory would be helpful, but efforts to do that at a national level are still relatively new.\n",
      "\n",
      "And although there may be consensus on how best to protect communities from wildfire risk – a joint federal, provincial and territorial vision statement for a Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy was released in 2006 – that strategy hasn’t been fully rolled out, partly owing to its multi-jurisdictional nature and its high cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a country, we have a national plan on how to get ready for wildfires and how to manage and minimize the risk going forward,” says Paul Kovacs, executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, a non-profit group that focuses on disaster prevention and research. “What we don’t have is a plan that has been implemented and funded.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There are national programs. In 1982, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre was set up so that jurisdictions could share personnel, aircraft and equipment among themselves and with international partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "FireSmart Canada, a program meant to help communities protect themselves from damaging impacts of wildfires, dates back to 1990, when a committee was set up to address common concerns about wildfires in WUI terrain. Scores of FireSmart programs have been rolled out throughout the country in areas such as fuel management (clearing brush around WUI communities) or public education.\n",
      "\n",
      "But despite those programs, experts say there’s not a comprehensive enough strategy backed by sufficient funds to tackle the issue.\n",

      "Open this photo in gallery: The Abasands neighbourhood of Fort McMurray, Alta. was decimated by wildfire in May 2016. The Fort McMurray fires resulted in billions of dollars’ worth of damage.The Canadian Press\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, a group made of up federal, provincial and territorial forestry ministers, released a report that reviewed the previous decade’s efforts to roll out the Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy, saying that while some progress had been made, actions had been “somewhat ad hoc” and that a lack of standardized reporting made it difficult to track progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that void, many jurisdictions have taken their own steps to tackle wildfire risk, Mr. Kovacs says, particularly in B.C. and Alberta, where large wildfires – as in Kelowna in 2003 and in Fort McMurray in 2016 – resulted in billions of dollars’ worth of damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildland fire ecologist Robert Gray, based in Chilliwack, B.C., says B.C.’s FireSmart grant program can be difficult to navigate and puts smaller communities, especially Indigenous communities, at a disadvantage compared with larger centres that have greater capacity to apply for grants and hire personnel to administer programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the grant program isn’t operating at the scale required to make a dent in wildfire prevention, he says, noting that it took two years to cobble together funds – about $180,000 – to carry out a 79-hectare prescribed burn at the Canadian Rockies International Airport in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress is happening, albeit not as quickly or efficiently as many would like. In 2021, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers endorsed a five-year action plan to implement the previously-announced national wildfire strategy, noting that Canada now “regularly experiences large, catastrophic wildland fire events.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in 2022, B.C. announced wildfire funding that would, among other things, allow the B.C. Wildfire Service to run year-round. On June 1, as part of an update on wildfire programs, federal officials announced Ottawa had signed agreements to train 300 Indigenous firefighters and 125 Indigenous fire guardians this season.\n",

      "\n",
      "In reviewing community wildfire protection plans introduced over the past decade in B.C. and Alberta, Mr. Kovacs has seen two hurdles that keep those plans from being fully implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is money – it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to thin and prune nearby forests, for example – and the second is the debate over whether fire-mitigation measures should be required or recommended, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the question of how to limit expansion into WUI areas is a prickly one, with growing populations and people’s desire to live close to wooded areas bumping up against wildfire threats. In a 2018 ICLR report, Mr. Kovacs looked at how local governments could use development permits to require certain fire-resistant building materials and “to control and even prohibit” residential development in areas of high wildfire risk. In that report, he said “more than a dozen” communities in B.C. and Alberta had begun to use development permits to control residential development in WUI areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s currently working on an update, but doesn’t expect to see a big jump in the number of communities taking that approach, saying it remains relatively rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kovacs would like to see a firm funding commitment for a national wildfire strategy, as well as clarity on how goals are to be met.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you encourage outcomes that are better than we are experiencing right now – if it’s not through regulation, how do you get there? And that is an important political conversation,” he adds.\n",

      "That question, and the tensions around it, can be read between the lines of a 2022 update on the Community Wildfire Resilience Plan for Kelowna, where the Okanagan Mountain Park fire in 2003 ripped through more than 25,000 hectares close to the city, forced the evacuation of more than 27,000 people and destroyed 239 homes.\n",

      "The city’s wildfire plans, introduced in 2011 and updated in 2016, have allowed it to take “many productive strides” toward reducing wildfire threats, the report said. But the community’s exposure to wildfire remains extreme, evacuation orders have become the norm for multiple communities, and structure losses have been witnessed as recently as August of 2021, the report said, adding that, “an ever challenging climate, hazardous topography, and development trends that have seen growth extend further into the wildland urban interface (WUI) have put Kelowna in a difficult position.”\n",

      "Canada has a data gap in its tracking of wildfire risk for vulnerable communities\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike geographical features like floodplains, the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) arises largely from people’s choices. As Canadians build more houses amid wildland vegetation, wildfires in those areas become more consequential: they destroy more things we care about. The likelihood of ignition also increases, because people cause about half of Canada’s wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be advantageous, then, to know where Canada’s WUI (pronounced “woo-ee”) is expanding, and how rapidly. But we don’t. We also don’t have tools for assessing wildfire risk like we have for flooding and earthquakes. We even lack crucial data inputs, such as high-resolution maps of vegetation and other fire fuels, or detailed records about fires over a sufficiently long time period to capture the variability of fire regimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "These data gaps impede our ability to take full advantage of the fact that there are plenty of effective strategies for reducing risk. Homeowners in the WUI can change roofing, siding and ventilation. Municipalities can regulate land use planning in the WUI to prevent expansion into high-risk areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just as there’s so many overwhelming problems, there’s just as many options for helping and mitigating risk, or adapting to fire on the landscape,” said Lynn Johnston, a fire scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Johnston is among the researchers who are tackling the blind spots. Until 2016, nobody could say where the WUI began and ended. She mapped it while completing her Master’s degree at the University of Alberta. That exercise revealed 32.3 million hectares of WUI, representing 3.8 per cent of Canada’s total land mass. Since then, British Columbia created and updated maps depicting at-risk areas within its WUI.\n",
      "\n",
      "American researchers fret about their own data gaps, although they’re generally ahead of us. In 2018, one group mapped decadal changes in the U.S. WUI between 1990 and 2010 within census blocks and discovered that over that time, it had grown by 189,000 square kilometres, an area larger than Washington State.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As long as WUI growth is unchecked, wildfire problems will likely worsen,” they warned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. is also further along in developing formal methods of assessing wildfire risks. But Ms. Johnston said the Canada Forest Service, provincial fire managers and certain universities, are pressing forward. And many crucial inputs for assessing fire risk, such as the locations of buildings and climate models, already exist and are evolving rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We really need to start mapping these things,” she said.\n",

      "\n",
      "But despite those programs, experts say there’s not a comprehensive enough strategy backed by sufficient funds to tackle the issue.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2016, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, a group made of up federal, provincial and territorial forestry ministers, released a report that reviewed the previous decade’s efforts to roll out the Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy, saying that while some progress had been made, actions had been “somewhat ad hoc” and that a lack of standardized reporting made it difficult to track progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that void, many jurisdictions have taken their own steps to tackle wildfire risk, Mr. Kovacs says, particularly in B.C. and Alberta, where large wildfires – as in Kelowna in 2003 and in Fort McMurray in 2016 – resulted in billions of dollars’ worth of damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildland fire ecologist Robert Gray, based in Chilliwack, B.C., says B.C.’s FireSmart grant program can be difficult to navigate and puts smaller communities, especially Indigenous communities, at a disadvantage compared with larger centres that have greater capacity to apply for grants and hire personnel to administer programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the grant program isn’t operating at the scale required to make a dent in wildfire prevention, he says, noting that it took two years to cobble together funds – about $180,000 – to carry out a 79-hectare prescribed burn at the Canadian Rockies International Airport in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress is happening, albeit not as quickly or efficiently as many would like. In 2021, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers endorsed a five-year action plan to implement the previously-announced national wildfire strategy, noting that Canada now “regularly experiences large, catastrophic wildland fire events.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in 2022, B.C. announced wildfire funding that would, among other things, allow the B.C. Wildfire Service to run year-round. On June 1, as part of an update on wildfire programs, federal officials announced Ottawa had signed agreements to train 300 Indigenous firefighters and 125 Indigenous fire guardians this season.\n",

      "In reviewing community wildfire protection plans introduced over the past decade in B.C. and Alberta, Mr. Kovacs has seen two hurdles that keep those plans from being fully implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is money – it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to thin and prune nearby forests, for example – and the second is the debate over whether fire-mitigation measures should be required or recommended, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the question of how to limit expansion into WUI areas is a prickly one, with growing populations and people’s desire to live close to wooded areas bumping up against wildfire threats. In a 2018 ICLR report, Mr. Kovacs looked at how local governments could use development permits to require certain fire-resistant building materials and “to control and even prohibit” residential development in areas of high wildfire risk. In that report, he said “more than a dozen” communities in B.C. and Alberta had begun to use development permits to control residential development in WUI areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s currently working on an update, but doesn’t expect to see a big jump in the number of communities taking that approach, saying it remains relatively rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kovacs would like to see a firm funding commitment for a national wildfire strategy, as well as clarity on how goals are to be met.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you encourage outcomes that are better than we are experiencing right now – if it’s not through regulation, how do you get there? And that is an important political conversation,” he adds.\n",

      "That question, and the tensions around it, can be read between the lines of a 2022 update on the Community Wildfire Resilience Plan for Kelowna, where the Okanagan Mountain Park fire in 2003 ripped through more than 25,000 hectares close to the city, forced the evacuation of more than 27,000 people and destroyed 239 homes.\n",

But the community’s exposure to wildfire remains extreme, evacuation orders have become the norm for multiple communities, and structure losses have been witnessed as recently as August of 2021, the report said, adding that, “an ever challenging climate, hazardous topography, and development trends that have seen growth extend further into the wildland urban interface (WUI) have put Kelowna in a difficult position.”\n",

      "Canada has a data gap in its tracking of wildfire risk for vulnerable communities\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike geographical features like floodplains, the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) arises largely from people’s choices. As Canadians build more houses amid wildland vegetation, wildfires in those areas become more consequential: they destroy more things we care about. The likelihood of ignition also increases, because people cause about half of Canada’s wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be advantageous, then, to know where Canada’s WUI (pronounced “woo-ee”) is expanding, and how rapidly. But we don’t. We also don’t have tools for assessing wildfire risk like we have for flooding and earthquakes. We even lack crucial data inputs, such as high-resolution maps of vegetation and other fire fuels, or detailed records about fires over a sufficiently long time period to capture the variability of fire regimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "These data gaps impede our ability to take full advantage of the fact that there are plenty of effective strategies for reducing risk. Homeowners in the WUI can change roofing, siding and ventilation. Municipalities can regulate land use planning in the WUI to prevent expansion into high-risk areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just as there’s so many overwhelming problems, there’s just as many options for helping and mitigating risk, or adapting to fire on the landscape,” said Lynn Johnston, a fire scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Johnston is among the researchers who are tackling the blind spots. Until 2016, nobody could say where the WUI began and ended. She mapped it while completing her Master’s degree at the University of Alberta. That exercise revealed 32.3 million hectares of WUI, representing 3.8 per cent of Canada’s total land mass. Since then, British Columbia created and updated maps depicting at-risk areas within its WUI.\n",
      "\n",
      "American researchers fret about their own data gaps, although they’re generally ahead of us. In 2018, one group mapped decadal changes in the U.S. WUI between 1990 and 2010 within census blocks and discovered that over that time, it had grown by 189,000 square kilometres, an area larger than Washington State.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As long as WUI growth is unchecked, wildfire problems will likely worsen,” they warned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. is also further along in developing formal methods of assessing wildfire risks. But Ms. Johnston said the Canada Forest Service, provincial fire managers and certain universities, are pressing forward. And many crucial inputs for assessing fire risk, such as the locations of buildings and climate models, already exist and are evolving rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We really need to start mapping these things,” she said.\n",

Despite the good news, he said it was unclear when the thousands of evacuated residents would be able to return home. The evacuation zone was lifted in some areas that were undamaged by fire late Friday, but Meldrum said there is still more work to do to ensure the remaining areas under evacuation will be safe for residents. Nova Scotia is having one of its worst fire seasons on record, with 11 active wildfires in the province as of Friday evening, according to the province’s natural resources department. In the southwestern corner of the province, a large wildfire continued to burn out of control in Shelburne County, where 6,700 people have been evacuated from their homes — about half of the municipality’s population. The Barrington Lake wildfire, which started Saturday, continued to grow on Friday, reaching 230 square kilometres — the largest recorded wildfire in the province’s history. It has consumed at least 50 homes and cottages. The province said two other smaller wildfires are also out of control: one in the District of Shelburne and another in Pubnico, Yarmouth County.\n",

      "Article content “We are moving from a state of out of control to a state of being held,” he said. “And basically what that means is that, with the current resources that we have on site and with the suppression efforts that have taken place, the fire is not likely to spread.” Steeves said a number of areas of concern remain and crews continue to closely monitor hot spots around the fire’s perimeter. He warned the blaze was far from out and embers could still hide deep in places where the rain doesn’t penetrate, causing a risk of reignition.\n",

      "tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Play Video The wildfire that broke out Sunday in the Halifax area raced through a number of subdivisions, consuming about 200 structures — including 151 homes — and forcing the evacuation of more than 16,000 people. Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency Deputy Fire Chief Dave Meldrum says rain has brought relief, but also raises the risk that firefighters could be hurt from slips or falls and makes for difficult working conditions. “They’re going to be very very dirty, they’re going to be wet, they’re going to be cold,” he said of the firefighters. “So we welcome this rain but it’s going to be a tough working day.”\n",

      "Article content He said there were two reported injuries related to heat stress so far, and one firefighter bumped their head while moving equipment, but nobody has been seriously hurt. Despite the good news, he said it was unclear when the thousands of evacuated residents would be able to return home. The evacuation zone was lifted in some areas that were undamaged by fire late Friday, but Meldrum said there is still more work to do to ensure the remaining areas under evacuation will be safe for residents. Nova Scotia is having one of its worst fire seasons on record, with 11 active wildfires in the province as of Friday evening, according to the province’s natural resources department. In the southwestern corner of the province, a large wildfire continued to burn out of control in Shelburne County, where 6,700 people have been evacuated from their homes — about half of the municipality’s population. The Barrington Lake wildfire, which started Saturday, continued to grow on Friday, reaching 230 square kilometres — the largest recorded wildfire in the province’s history. It has consumed at least 50 homes and cottages. The province said two other smaller wildfires are also out of control: one in the District of Shelburne and another in Pubnico, Yarmouth County.\n",

      "Canada could exceed the largest total amount of burned area recorded in this country in a single year, as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires and puts Indigenous communities at higher risk, according to new federal numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural Resources Canada released updated data and forecasts Monday showing that, as of June 4, there had been 2,214 wildfires across Canada this year, and about 3.3 million hectares burned. The 10-year average over the same timeframe is 1,624 fires and 254,429 hectares burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The department said it is unusual to have blazes across most of the country this early in the wildfire season, and that Canada could pass the annual record for burned area if the current rate of fire activity continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures and analysis were released in conjunction with a Monday news conference by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his ministers to discuss the data. Mr. Trudeau expressed a willingness to spend more on support if the situation worsens.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With the given projections, it is expected that we have enough resources to cover the summer,” Mr. Trudeau said. “If things get worse, we’re developing contingency plans and we will of course make sure that we are there … to ensure that all Canadians are protected right through this summer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Questions of how to protect communities from wildfire risk loom large as thousands flee homes nationwide\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian Simpson, a semi-retired consultant based in Castlegar, B.C., who spent four decades fighting wildfires and eventually led B.C.’s Wildfire Service, said Canada’s system for fighting these disasters is based on the idea that only one side of the country will burn at a time. That way, provinces with lower levels of risk can share their firefighters and equipment, which has worked well in years past.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, with so many fires burning from the Atlantic to B.C. so early in the season, the system is facing major pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you start to get into this quandary where there’s not enough resources for the amount of fire on the ground, and the larger jurisdictions, who are typically the ones that are going to be providing lots of resources outside, are starting to pull back because they’re starting to either get fires or they’re imminently going to have [them],” Mr. Simpson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wetter weather should continue to help Alberta and Nova Scotia with the fires burning in those places, he said, but Quebec still faces major hurdles battling blazes, and B.C. is set for a very dry and dangerous June.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, 198 Canadian firefighters have travelled to other provinces this season to pitch in, and 957 foreign firefighters have landed in Canada, federal officials said during their Monday briefing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quebec Premier François Legault said more than 480 firefighters are fighting about 30 fires in his province. But more than 160 forest fires are burning there, he added, and international support is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I talk to the premiers of other provinces, they have their hands full,” Mr. Legault told reporters in Quebec City on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Legault said an additional 200 firefighters are coming from France and the United States, and Quebec is also in talks with Costa Rica, Portugal and Chile as it searches for additional resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said no lives have been lost in the province’s fires, but they have forced about 10,000 people from their homes, most of them in the northwestern Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, and the eastern Côte-Nord region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diane Rioux was making dinner at home in Lebel-sur-Quévillon on Friday, when the small city in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region issued a warning. Immediately, she asked her oldest daughter to grab a pen so she could dictate a list of what they would need to bring if they had to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the evacuation order came shortly after, Ms. Rioux, her husband and her three children packed medication, clothes and hygiene products before joining a convoy of people who had been ordered out of the area.\n",

      "She promptly called her husband, who stepped outside to take a look and initially thought the smoke was coming from a house fire. But the true scope of the blaze soon became clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the store, she met a woman who reported fleeing her subdivision without the chance to collect clothes for her child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kottwitz offered the woman room at her daycare centre, thinking evacuees could use the space. The daycare typically hosted 82 children between the ages of three months and 12 years, but had closed for the day that Sunday afternoon.\n",

      "\n",
      "“That fire moved rapidly … fast. It was so windy that day,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She grabbed her passport, birth certificate and a few important documents and ran to her car with her four dogs: an Irish setter, Oliver, an Irish setter and golden retriever mix, Bella, and two golden retriever puppies, Tucker and Forester.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I threw them in that car so fast. And they’re heavy dogs,” she said. “You get three in, one wants to get out, right? So by the time you get all four in, you’re pretty shaken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kottwitzes are currently staying in an apartment they can access until Friday and are planning to move to a hotel until they can return to a smaller house closer to their property. Terri Kottwitz marvelled at the seeming randomness of the destruction, which was widespread but left some key buildings intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“(The fire) took our (main) house but didn’t take our little house with my husband’s big garage,” she said. “It took the (daycare) centre but it didn’t take the other two buildings that were right beside the centre. It took the outhouse and the surrounding woods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The kids’ hammocks, sleeping bags and other belongings also survived the wildfire. The family’s ducklings, chickens and bees were also spared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kottwitz said she learned what was saved and what was burned from others posting on social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nova Scotia government arranged for residents to board buses so they could see their properties, but Kottwitz opted not to make the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll start building a new daycare centre as soon as possible, although we have a temporary location right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While happy new memories lie ahead, Kottwitz said the things that made past ones precious are lost for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had music boxes that my children gave to me when they were little. They’re all gone,” she said. “The snow globes aren’t replaceable. Some of the (things) children at the made are not replaceable.”\n"

      "\n",
      "Kyiv authorities acknowledged that their forces were stepping up offensive operations and making gains, but suggested some of the Russian announcements were misinformation as speculation grows about a widely anticipated counteroffensive after more than 15 months of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, recent drone attacks on Moscow, cross-border raids into Russia and sabotage and drone attacks on infrastructure behind Russian lines, has unnerved Russians. As well, TV and radio broadcasts in several regions of Russia were hacked today as a fake broadcast featured a voice impersonating Russian President Vladimir Putin saying that Ukrainian forces had invaded the Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk regions of Russia.\n",

      "Nikki Haley, former U.N. ambassador under Donald Trump, and the only woman in the race for the Republican nomination, went after her chief rivals over their position on the war in Ukraine.

Many cases received publication bans without the complainant even being aware of it. And victims who break their bans risk stiff penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "New legislation is in the pipe which rethinks how such court orders are imposed on victims of sexual offences. The bill proposes that Crown attorneys must ask victims whether they want a publication ban before ordering one. And victims who decide to change or revoke their bans must be given a hearing to do so. Zosia Bielski and Molly Hayes investigate.\n",

      "A smoky haze floated over a wide swath of the northern United States on Tuesday from Canada, where hundreds of wildfires were blazing, triggering air alerts from Minnesota to Massachusetts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ontario, a layer of haze blanketed parts of Ottawa and Toronto, where Canadian officials warned residents about the poor air quality, as smoke floated over portions of New York State and Vermont. All of New York City was under an air quality alert on Tuesday because of the smoke; by the afternoon, the Manhattan skyline was obscured by hazy skies.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 400 active wildfires were burning in Canada on Tuesday, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center, exacerbating an already active wildfire season that is only expected to worsen. More than 200 of the fires were burning out of control, the agency said. In eastern Canada, Quebec was most affected by wildfires as of early Tuesday afternoon, with more than 150 active blazes across the area, according to the fire agency. Residents in some areas were being encouraged to shut their windows and doors, local officials in Quebec said. Videos and images showed some fires blazing for miles, sending dark smoke plumes billowing into the sky. Here’s what else to know about the smoke: As of Monday, an estimated 26,000 people across Canada had been evacuated from their homes because of wildfires, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of public safety, said at the news conference.“The images that we have seen so far this season are some of the most severe ever witnessed in Canada,” Mr. Blair said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bands of smoke from the wildfires shifted southward across the border on Tuesday, creating hazy skies and prompting the U.S. National Weather Service to issue air quality alerts for parts of the upper Great Lakes and the Northeast. Large sections of Minnesota were under an air quality alert through Tuesday evening , the Weather Service said, as light winds pushed smoke from wildfires in Quebec across the state. Smoke also moved into Minnesota from Lake Superior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weather officials warned that people more sensitive to poor air quality, such as people with lung disease and heart disease, children and older adults, should limit certain activities outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Air quality alerts were also in place in New York City and in multiple counties in upstate New York through midnight. Mayor Eric Adams of New York said on Twitter that New Yorkers with heart or breathing issues should limit their time outside to “to the absolute necessities.” Poor air quality was expected to continue into Wednesday for much of upstate New York and the New York City region, according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\n",

      "[] 2023-06-06 12:12:24-04:00 Canada could exceed the largest total amount of burned area recorded in this country in a single year. Natural Resources Canada released updated data and forecasts Monday showing that, as of June 4, there had been 2,214 wildfires across Canada this year, and about 3.3 million hectares burned. The 10-year average over the same timeframe is 1,624 fires and 254,429 hectares burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The department said it is unusual to have blazes across most of the country this early in the wildfire season, and that Canada could pass the annual record for burned area if the current rate of fire activity continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one Quebec city that had been threatened by wildfires lifted an evacuation order Tuesday, authorities turned their attention to communities in the northern and northwestern parts of the province where firefighters worked to beat back threats from out-of-control blazes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re following all of this from hour to hour, obviously,” Premier François Legault told reporters in Sept-Îles, Que. “If we look at the situation in Quebec as a whole, there are several places where it is still worrying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the province’s forest fire prevention agency, more than 150 forest fires were burning in the province on Tuesday, including more than 110 deemed out of control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Quebec Premier Francois Legault checks the map where forest fires are raging as he visits the crisis operation centre in Quebec City on June 5, 2023.Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press\n",
      "\n",
      "Legault said the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region in northwestern Quebec is an area of particular concern, with the communities of Normétal and Lebel-sur-Quévillon under threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mayor of Lebel-sur-Quévillon, where about 2,100 people were forced from their homes on the weekend, said the fire is about 10 kilometres outside of town, but its advance has been slower than expected. “The fire started in an area where there were no trees, which slowed it down considerably,” Guy Lafrenière said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other northern communities at risk include Chibougamau, where crews have been creating firebreaks, and the Cree village of Chisasibi on the eastern shore of James Bay. Firefighting resources have also been dispatched to Hydro-Québec’s Micoua substation near Baie-Comeau, Legault said.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, Legault said authorities had no choice but to leave the hamlet of Clova to burn, drawing the ire of local residents. Legault said Tuesday that he had simply repeated what fire prevention officials told him: the fire around the tiny community about 325 kilometres northwest of Montreal was too intense to send water bombers. That remained true Tuesday, he said, but he noted that no homes had burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dominic Vincent, the owner of the Auberge Restaurant Clova, said that by Monday afternoon, the situation in the area had already improved, aided by cooler temperatures and a change in wind direction. While smoke remained visible, it was far less intense, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vincent said that for three days residents worked with crews from Quebec’s forest fire prevention agency, SOPFEU, to protect the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "“SOPFEU cut fire breaks and we filled tanks with water, along with our friends from the outfitters next to us, to be able to help the places that didn’t have water and then we tried to stop the fire along the side of the roads,” he said in an interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, the situation was difficult, though it started to improve by the end of the day, he said. Monday, when Legault said the town would be left to burn, was actually a day of progress against the fire, Vincent said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was above all a lack of communication,” he said. “It was a statement that was a day late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With so many fires burning, Legault said authorities were focusing on towns and critical infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legault met with civil security officials and firefighting teams in Sept-Îles, Que., where an evacuation order affecting about 4,500 residents of the town and the nearby Innu community of Mani-Utenam was lifted Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sept-Îles Mayor Steeve Beaupré told a separate news conference that the fire was no longer deemed a threat, but he warned residents to be ready to leave again should the situation change.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to make it clear that the fight is far from over,” Beaupré said after delivering the good news. “The fire is still large and active and it could remain so for several days, even several weeks, which means that we could be forced to evacuate certain sectors of Sept-Îles again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Public Security Minister François Bonnardel was in northwestern Quebec where he said more firefighters were expected Wednesday. He said there are concerns for hydro transmission lines and a high-speed internet connection link to the North.\n",
      "\n",
      "He defended the government’s response to the fires, saying the province is doing everything it can, but all provinces are dealing with their own wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re experiencing an unprecedented situation, exceptional, everywhere on Quebec territory,” Bonnardel said. “We’ve never had so many fires so early in the season, it’s not just a problem for Quebec, it’s a problem all over Canada.”\n",

Last week, U.S. officials as far south as Maryland, Baltimore, Virginia and Pennsylvania reported being impacted by the wildfires.\n",

      "Environment Canada was warning that wildfire smoke can be harmful to public health, even at low concentrations.\n",

      "\n",
      "As of 2 p.m. on Tuesday, Environment Canada was assessing Ottawa’s air quality as a nine out of 10 on a scale used to measure the severity of conditions, meaning it was high-risk to the local population. Earlier in the day, air quality had been measured at 10+ or deemed as very high-risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a very, very deteriorated air quality. It is the worst in Canada at the moment,” Steven Flisfeder, an Environment Canada meteorologist, said in an interview.\n",

      "The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board was advising schools under its jurisdiction to keep students inside for recess.\n",
      "\n",
      "The public school board cancelled a regional track meet scheduled for Tuesday. And First Avenue Public School, just south of downtown Ottawa, cancelled a field trip to Gatineau Park across the river in Quebec due to the air conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The City of Ottawa also cancelled all outdoor recreational programs, activities and leagues operated by the city that were scheduled for Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor air quality also garnered the attention of federal politicians on Parliament Hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think we all noticed, even coming into work this morning, you can strongly smell the smoke and see it in the air, and we’re even seeing dust and ash starting to accumulate on surfaces. And so, it is a little concerning,” Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said before the Liberal government’s weekly cabinet meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blair said older adults, children and people with respiratory conditions should avoid outdoor activities and suggested that wearing a mask outdoors would be a “really good idea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have never seen this in my life. It’s incredible! And I see a lot of people wearing the mask today,” Government House leader Mark Holland said upon arriving for the cabinet meeting.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fire adviser Shayne McCool, with Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, said Tuesday that wildfires near Cochrane, Ont., had seen “significant growth” in the last two days.\n",
      "\n",
      "One wildfire tripled in size from 600 hectares to 1,840 hectares, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another fire near Cochrane stood at 1,239 hectares and was considered “not under control.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, we’re seeing a lot more smoke in the air today and that’s pretty obvious across most of the northeast (of the province),” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though McCool said there had been no official evacuations by Tuesday afternoon, some people in the area were asked to leave as a safety precaution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Closer to Ottawa, a forest fire was set ablaze near Centennial Lake on Sunday and residents of Greater Madawaska — a municipality about 150 kilometres west of Ottawa — were evacuated from their homes.\n",

      "The testing is necessary because in areas where the fire moved through, the groundwater could be contaminated by residue from the fire, chemical fire retardants and fuel from ruptured tanks.\n",

      "\n",
      "Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is calling on the Liberals to keep “multiple murderers” in maximum-security prison, as fallout continues over the transfer of convicted killer Paul Bernardo to a medium-security institution in Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Ontario Premier Doug Ford is looking for the ouster of the federal corrections commissioner after the move, which was made public last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne Kelly, commissioner of the Correctional Service Canada, announced the transfer was under review after Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said he told how shocked Canadians were by the decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mendicino says he is open to looking at the options when it comes to adjusting the government’s policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking from the legislature, Ford said Canadians have lost confidence in Kelly’s decision-making and asked that she “step aside, step down or be fired.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sorry for the language, but he’s nothing but a scumbag,” Ford said of Bernardo, whose transfer as also garnered widespread backlash from police associations in Ontario.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This S.O.B. needs to be in jail 23 hours a day in a maximum security (facility).”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bernardo is serving a life sentence for the kidnapping, torture and murders of 15-year-old Kristen French in 1991 and 14-year-old Leslie Mahaffy in 1992. He was also convicted of manslaughter in the 1990 death of Tammy Homolka, the 15-year-old sister of his then-wife, Karla Homolka.\n",
      "\n",
      "Homolka pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the crimes committed against French and Mahaffy, and was released in 2005 after serving a 12-year sentence. Bernardo also admitted to sexually assaulting 14 other women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mendicino has said he is unable to reverse the transfer decision because the federal correctional service operates as an independent institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Poilievre said Tuesday he rejects that explanation and demanded Trudeau step in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m calling on the prime minister to direct his public safety minister to say that all mass murderers should have to serve their entire sentences in maximum security prisons,” Poilievre told reporters Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a no-brainer and the prime minister can do it. He’s got to stop passing the buck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Poilievre’s office has suggested that such power exists in the form of directives from ministers, which are typically used to address broad policy issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mendicino said Tuesday he expects the review into Bernardo’s transfer will only take a couple of weeks “at the most,” and suggested any discussion around policy changes must wait until its conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look, if there are issues with regards to policies, with regards to the principles, even with regards to the legislation – I’m going to leave all of those options on the table,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll see where we are at in a couple of weeks’ time and after that, if we need to revisit the legislation or any of their policies or directions, then we’ll do that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The correctional service said it understands Bernardo’s transfer comes as a shock to some and acknowledged in a statement Monday that it did not intend to cause harm to his victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has said decisions around the security classification for offenders must adhere with the law and depends on factors such as their risk to public safety, their threat of escaping and psychological assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why Bernardo was moved has not been divulged, but the prison he was transferred to is known for housing violent sex offenders and specializes in treating people convicted of sexual offences.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, Mendicino said “we do have access to those reasons” for Bernardo’s transfer, but stressed that because of privacy provisions, it is up to the federal correctional service to decide whether it can release those reasons publicly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do believe that given the fact that this matter is now public, that Canadians are entitled to an explanation,” he said.\n"

      "The cannabis retailer, which operates 91 stores across Canada and employs 774 people, has applied for protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, and obtained a $9.8-million debtor-in-possession loan from an existing stakeholder, a subsidiary of Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. ATD-T, to pay off existing liabilities while it attempts to restructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company operates retail stores, a distribution service, and various digital platforms and software products related to the cannabis industry. It also owns a number of other brands, including Pineapple Express Delivery Inc., Hifyre Inc. and Friendly Stranger Holdings Corp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire & Flower’s CCAA filing is the latest in a series of major cannabis industry setbacks, including layoffs, mergers and bankruptcy claims, as companies fight to lower prices and attract customers in an oversupplied market.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an affidavit submitted as part of the application to the CCAA, chief executive officer Stephane Trudel said the company had been operating at a loss since 2018. Most recently, the company suffered operating losses of $83.4-million in the year ended Dec. 2022. He said the losses were driven by regulatory restrictions and pressure to margins. The company has suffered combined losses of more than $200-million since 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company’s cash position has also been dwindling for years. As of March 31, the company had over $50.8-million in current liabilities compared with $38-million in current assets, including just $8.2-million in cash – a position that has since deteriorated further, Mr. Trudel said.\n",
      "\n",
      "About half of the company’s total liabilities are tied to leases for stores, some of which never turned a profit because they were not granted cannabis sale licenses by the government, and which have been sublet for other purposes. The company intends to slim down its costs by dropping these “dead lease” stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2021, the company’s exclusive source of outside investment has been through the exercise of warrants and debt financing by its largest shareholder, Alimentation Couche-Tard subsidiary ACT Investor. In April, the company had discussions with competitors and financial institutions about potential funding or acquisitions, but were not successful, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Trudel pointed to the abundance of retail cannabis stores, the illicit market and provincial operators – from whom all retailers must buy their products with a markup – as fueling Fire & Flower’s downfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The retailers were unaware that many of its retail stores would have several other cannabis retailers within close proximity,” he said. “Retailers also have to compete with the illicit market that continues to sell cannabis products that do not comply with the strict regulations of the Cannabis Act.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The company is asking that its liabilities be stayed until September 1, and that it be allowed to take out more debtor loans to restructure.\n"

      "[] 2023-06-07 00:00:00 Smoke from wildfires in Canada has drifted down into the U.S. on Wednesday, leading to extremely poor air quality across much of the eastern U.S., with alerts in effect all the way from New England to the Southeast. In all, more than 100 million Americans were affected by air quality alerts, the Environmental Protection Agency said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, New York City's air quality was the worst among the world's major cities for a time Tuesday morning, according to IQAir, an air quality monitoring website. As of Wednesday afternoon, IQAir said New York City's pollution was fourth-worst in the world, behind New Delhi, India; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Toronto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the unhealthy air, Major League Baseball postponed Wednesday night's games in New York and Philadelphia. It's the first such postponement since September 2020, when two games between the Seattle Mariners and the San Francisco Giants were moved from Seattle to San Francisco due to wildfire-related smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul tweeted Wednesday that the state is making 1 million N95 masks available to the public due to the ongoing poor air quality from the Canadian wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are living in the era of extreme weather. Last summer, New York experienced extremely dry conditions and we had wildfires pop up across the state,\" Hochul said. \"While continuing our fight against climate change, we need to recognize that this is a new reality we have to be prepared for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor air quality on Wednesday even made it as far south as Atlanta, where the National Weather Service said \"particularly sensitive groups may be affected in north Georgia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sara Adar, from the University of Michigan's School of Public Health, said \"as many people in the Midwest and East Coast are learning right now, wildfire smoke can travel very far distances and impact large populations. To best protect health, people should avoid spending too much time outdoors right now, especially young children, the elderly, pregnant women and those with heart or lung disease,\" she said.\n",

      "More than 100 million people affected by air quality alerts\n",

      "According to EPA spokesperson Shayla R. Powell, the EPA estimates that \"more than 100 million people are affected by air quality alerts today, ranging from Code Orange (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) and above. This area includes much of the Northeast U.S. – extending to Chicago to the west and Atlanta to the south.\n",

      "\"We expect that air quality in this area is predominantly impacted by the Canadian wildfires, although more localized pollution emissions and meteorology may also play a factor,\" Powell said.\n",

      "Meanwhile, at Newark's Liberty Airport, the airport reported that low visibility was leading to a ground stop for some arriving flights.\n",

      "From Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood, where the Manhattan skyline is usually easily seen, the towers were barely visible through the brown haze. It seemed more like a foggy morning than an early June afternoon.\n",

      "Mikael Haxby, 43, was walking his dog toward the waterfront, a medical facemask strapped tight over his mouth and nose. He said he had a burning feeling in his throat. “I’m somewhat used to wearing the mask,\" he said. \"It’s more just like the air quality is bad.” He said his child would have recess inside Wednesday, as all city schools had announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plenty of others went maskless, however, and some were donning the “chin strap” former Gov. Andrew Cuomo once chided during his daily pandemic press conferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid the haze, public gathering spots sat mostly empty. A popular outdoor brunch restaurant, usually bustling even on a weekday, looked deserted. McCarren Park, home to the neighborhood track, had only a few joggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was actually coughing,” Deborah Gross, 29, said, from behind her white N-95 mask. She was late to meet a friend because she had to stop into a drug store to buy a mask, a move that reminded her of riding out the pandemic in the city. “I saw people wearing masks on the street,\" she said, \"and I was like, 'Whoa, throwback.’”\n",

      "What are air quality alerts?\n",
      "\n",
      "Air quality alerts are indicators the air is unsafe to breathe for certain people. Alerts are triggered by a number of factors, including the detection of fine-particle pollution — known as “PM 2.5” — which can irritate the lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pollution is detected by a system of monitors on the ground “constantly taking measurements of the amount of chemicals and particles in the air,” said Susan Anenberg, professor and department chair of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University.\n",

      "'Impossible ... to escape it' for people experiencing homelessness\n",

      "As much of the Northeast is blanketed in a haze of smoke drifting down from hundreds of Canadian wildfires, people are being told to stay inside as much as possible on Wednesday.\n",

      "That’s not so easy for people experiencing homelessness, advocates say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For our neighbors living outside, it's impossible for them to escape it,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, senior manager for policy and advocacy at the nonprofit Miriam’s Kitchen in the nation’s capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the cities most impacted by unhealthy air quality from the fires also see some of the highest rates of homelessness in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parts of New York City and Washington, D.C., hovered between a red and purple air quality designation during the day, according to airnow.gov. That means the air is unhealthy for the general population, and people are recommended to reduce physical activity and consider going indoors. School children were kept inside for recess. Anyone with additional health risks should move all their activities indoors, officials said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are hundreds of our neighbors who don't have a choice but to stay outside, which must compel us to end homelessness and ensure that everyone has the housing that they need to thrive,” Rabinowitz said.\n",

The smoke, he later said by phone, even made him a bit dizzy.\n",

      "This would be similar to the barriers around the ice rinks where Canadians play what they call “hockey,” the game we Americans know as “ice football.” I’m not sure exactly how high smoke travels, but I’m going to guess it’s about 11 billion feet. So this project will be a boon for the American plexiglass industry. The barrier should keep the smoke on the Canadian side, and it will be clear so we can still see the moose.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Place box fans along the border\n",
      "\n",
      "President Joe Biden could give the U.S. Border Patrol access to America’s strategic box-fan reserves, allowing agents to line up fans from the northwest corner of Washington state to the northeast corner of Maine. This would also require tapping into our strategic extension-cord reserves, but desperate times call for desperate measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Invade Canada\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my personal favorite option, because it involves something America is great at: Invading other countries because we want to. It’s unlikely our forces will meet any resistance (does Canada even have an army?), and once the invasion is complete, we can deal with the forest fires ourselves, using an idea former President Donald Trump brought up in 2018 when California was battling wildfires: “You’ve got to take care of the floors. You know the floors of the forests, it’s very important.” Yes, the floors of forests are very important, and I’m sure if we follow Trump’s suggestion and do some “raking and cleaning” of Canada’s forest floors, we can clear the whole wildfire mess up in no time.

      "['David Wallace-Wells'] 2023-06-07 00:00:00 In Quebec, more than a hundred wildfires were characterized as “out of control” by local authorities. Across Canada, 13 times as much land has burned by this date as in recent years, many of which had extreme or unprecedented levels of fire at the time. And we’re still two weeks from summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before this Tuesday’s surge of smoke, Jeva Lange at Heatmap had calculated that East Coasters had inhaled more wildfire pollution so far this year than most of their counterparts on the West Coast, thanks to a quieter early fire season in California. “The air is compromised from Minneapolis to D.C. to Boston,” The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang reported on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month ago, as off-the-charts wildfires raged in Alberta, I wrote about one of the scariest revelations of new wildfire science: There’s nowhere to escape the smoke. Sixty percent of the pollution from American wildfires is experienced by people living outside the state in which the trees are actually burning.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phenomenon is harrowingly new: Between 2006 and 2010, according to one recent preprint, there was hardly any place in the West where smoke from other counties contributed as much as 10 percent of local air pollution; between 2016 and 2020, smoke from distant fires was contributing as much as half of local air pollution across huge swaths of the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already, the health impact of American wildfires is larger east of the Rockies than to the west. Across the country, the number of people exposed to what are sometimes called extreme smoke days has grown 27-fold in just a decade, and exposure to even-more-extreme smoke events has grown 11,000-fold. Since 2000, growing wildfire pollution has reversed significant gains from the Clean Air Act, and over the coming decades, it is poised to become the country’s main source of particulate pollution. In this way, the haunting gray glow of the sky this week was both a throwback to a more contaminated past and a portent of a future clouded more regularly by airborne toxic events such as these.\n"

In 1948, killer smog in Donora, Pa., affected nearly half the town’s residents and inspired the comprehensive Clean Air Act of 1970.

      "\n",
      "What are the short- and long-term health risks posed by air pollution from wildfires?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the short term, exposure to wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes and throat and cause runny noses, wheezing, phlegm production and headaches, according to Luisa Giles, an assistant professor in the school of kinesiology at the University of Fraser Valley, who focuses on the health effects of air pollution. It can cause some people to experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness, heart palpitations and impaired lung function, and can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s minimal research on any long-term health effects. But even so, Dr. Giles said, “an absence of evidence does not always indicate an absence of effect, therefore, it’s still recommended that individuals are cautious and aim to reduce their air pollution exposure where possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some initial research suggests exposure to air pollution from wildfires may be linked to increased risk of a range of health outcomes, including cancer and death from heart disease in older adults, and potentially dementia.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can you tell whether it’s safe to spend time outdoors?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Giles said a good place to start is checking the Air Quality Health Index for your area. This index is a scale from 1 to 10+ that provides an indicator of the health risk related to air quality and can be found on the Environment Canada website or provincial environment ministry sites. Alternatively, she suggests setting up Canada’s WeatherCAN app, which can alert you about what to do when the air quality is poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should you exercise when air quality is poor?\n",
      "\n",
      "When it’s smoky outside, exercising indoors is always a good first option, says Dr. Giles. Make sure, though, that your gym has its windows closed and is using HEPA filter, she advises. If the windows are open, or there isn’t a HEPA filter, then exercising indoors would be very similar to doing so outside. If you are exercising or spending time outdoors, however, you’ll still want to try and minimize exposure to air pollution, Dr. Giles says. You can do so, for example, by checking the Air Quality Health Index, and planning your outdoor activities to avoid times of the day when air pollution is worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can you do you protect yourself from health effects of wildfires?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pay attention to your exposure throughout the course of the day, and try to reduce it by, for example, keeping your windows closed (though try to not overheat) and using a HEPA filter if you have the means, Dr. Giles said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some areas may provide clean air shelters. These are libraries, community centres or schools where people can seek relief from smoky air. Health Canada published guidelines in 2020 for creating and managing clean air shelters during wildfire smoke events, which include ensuring they have HVAC systems that can filter fine particulate matter and are connected to an emergency power supply in case of power outages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Giles suggests you could also use a furnace filter with a higher MERV rating, such as 12 or 13, and keep your furnace fan running. Another option, she said, is wearing an N95 respirator if you are running errands or exercising wherever air quality is poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chris Carlsten, head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia and director of Vancouver Coastal Health’s Legacy for Airway Health program, said he, too, strongly recommends the use of air filters. This can be in the form of a small system in your bedroom, for example, or a large system for an entire building. Much of the advice on improving indoor air quality, such as using HEPA filters and regularly cleaning or changing filters on HVAC systems, will sound familiar after the past few years of COVID-19. (Though during wildfires, it’s not advisable to keep windows open.)\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to coping with the short-term health risks of exposure to wildfire smoke, it’s important to keep in mind that everyone will react differently, Dr. Carlsten said. Some people can exercise outside and not be bothered at all by it, while their peers don’t tolerate it well. So while those with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases ought to take greater precautions, he suggests letting your experience be your guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also recommends speaking with your health care provider about any concerns.\n",
      "\n",

      "['Ian Brown'] 2023-06-07 09:00:00-04:00 Open this photo in gallery: A really creamy spinach dip that features in the book Cook it Wild by Chris Nuttal-Smith.Maya Visnyei/Clarkson Potter\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s begin our discussion of Chris Nuttall-Smith’s new cookbook, Cook It Wild: Sensational Prep-Ahead Meals for Camping, Cabins and the Great Outdoors (Penguin, $40), with a brief appreciation of quartermasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a land army, the quartermaster is the soldier who supervises supplies and provisions. On a canoe trip or a hike or a back-country ski trip or even an RV excursion, the quartermaster/mistress is the hard-working keener who organizes the food. They are detail-oriented and can be punctilious. You don’t want to be the camper who forgot the valve for the WhisperLite stove when you’re halfway down the Alsek River in the middle of the Yukon’s Kluane wilderness in a torrential downpour and the quartermaster wants to make tea. Not to mention any names or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nuttall-Smith, a highly accomplished journalist, food writer (formerly restaurant critic at The Globe and Mail) and resident judge on Top Chef Canada, qualifies as an ultraimaginative quartermaster, and even an easy-going one – as long as you don’t keep opening and closing his all-important drinks cooler, thereby melting the ice that is preserving the slushy negronis he made back in the city and hauled all the way up to God-knows-where.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crux of it all? A make-ahead success plan\n",
      "\n",
      "The central premise of Cook It Wild is deceptively simple: anyone can eat fabulously in the wildest of places, as long as you prepare ahead of time, thereby reducing the work you have to do fireside after a long day of paddling/skiing/hiking/driving. There is nary a hot dog nor can of baked beans nor freeze-dried giblet to be seen in Cook It Wild. Its “empowering make-ahead, prep-ahead system,” as Nuttall-Smith describes it, is based on five key principles: Chop Ahead, Mix Ahead, Cook Ahead, Seal Ahead and Freeze Ahead, in that order. Eggs on a camping trip? No problem: whisk them at home and freeze them; they’ll last two days in a cooler. (Or pack them in doubled-up egg cartons, and don’t freeze them.)\n",
      "\n",
      "To help you achieve these noble, clarifying goals and eat like a fireside trencher, the first third of Cook It Wild is devoted to extra-culinary tricks every camper needs to know. These include how to properly pack a cooler (block ice on the bottom, and fill the air gap under the lid with a towel or refreezable ice packs); how to light, build and manage a cooking fire; how to make excellent coffee on said fire; which cheeses travel best; how to string your food in a tree, etc., etc., etc. Nuttall-Smith even provides diagrams of “the one and only knot you need to know.” He’s the greatest Scoutmaster who ever lived, except that, unlike any of the scoutmasters I ever knew, he’s also a terrific chef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each recipe lists special equipment needed and the number of people it serves – standard cookbook fare – but also the weight of its ingredients and an emoji-like symbol denoting the kind of camping for which the recipe is best suited (whether it’s winter camping, roadside in an RV or glamping in a yurt). Nuttall-Smith aims to demystify the daunting food organizing that scares so many off camping, while maximizing your holiday leisure, whether you are scaling Mount Robson or picnicking in your backyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, as a quartermaster at heart, Nuttall-Smith is occasionally a stickler, as he should be. He insists you buy a fine mesh strainer (and then cut off its handle, to save space) for filtering food scraps (which you must pack out) from your dishwater. He doesn’t insist on his packing plan, as long as you have one, but he clearly favours packing by meal type (all breakfasts in one bag, ditto lunches and dinners, cocktail snacks in another, and so on) rather than by day (which entails more cooler opening and closing).\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: A recipe for caramalized shallot-cheese fondue.Maya Visnyei/The Associated Press\n",
      "\n",
      "As someone who once went mountain climbing with nothing but freeze-dried food, which in turn caused Chernobylean clouds of gas to erupt from my guide as I followed him up vertical cliff walls, let me say this: Cook It Wild is very high-end camp eating. Instant Caramelized Shallot-Cheese Fondue, over a WhisperLite stove no less, on a long, energy-sapping back-packing trek? Yes, please. Powdermilk biscuits (baked in a Dutch oven buried in the ashes of a fire), or a phenomenal corn-cheddar-and-green-onion skillet cake for breakfast? Yes again. (Freeze the feta, so you don’t have to carry the heavy brine.) The book’s sides are original and delectable and also easy: puff-and-serve chapatis! Risottos! Enfoiled mushroom roasts! And then there’s campfire paella. “No other outdoors dish says party quite like paella,” Nuttall-Smith writes, adding that it is “the showstoppiest of showstoppers.” He proffers three versions, one of them vegan. Yes, you need an open fire to cook them, and a cooler to keep the squid and chicken and shrimp from spoiling, and a large heavy skillet or a paella pan. But it all fits in a canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "But make no mistake: Eating well in the simplicity of the wild takes more work than eating well just about anywhere else, in part because you prepare everything twice: once At Home (Nuttall-Smith divides every recipe this way) and again At Camp, ditto.\n",
      "\n",
      "The secret ingredient: A show of kindness\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent an entire recent Saturday shopping for and then cooking a luxurious Cook It Wild meal for six. (Which I then reheated on my backyard barbecue, as a simulation.) The meal was dinner-party worthy. Nuttall-Smith’s Freakishly Delicious Olives, Warmed by the Fire and marinated in smashed garlic and orange peel, were even better for having sat a day in their carefully sealed Baggie. His Silky Day-Glo Hummus, whirled from a roasted beet, was first rated A+ by my guests, and then A++. Olive Oil Pistachios (shelled and gently heated in same) got a look or two – ”Why heat pistachios in oil?” my wife, a pistachio fiend, asked – but it’s a subtler pistachio, a calmer nut that has had some therapy and is more amenable to conversation. (They were even better four days later.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fresh Lime Margaritas (19 ounces of weight in the drinks cooler) that Nuttall-Smith claims will keep two weeks frozen and two days thawed are so delicious they will actually only last one night. But the star of the evening, the dish one of my guests (a seasoned canoeist and quartermaster) made again the very next day for his children and grandchildren, was the Really Creamy Spinach. It weighed nearly two pounds and demanded nearly an hour of prep and cooking before I plopped it into its resealable freezer bag, but it was definitive creamed spinach. And I haven’t even mentioned the book’s desserts, none of which – for once – are the hideous degradation known as smores.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one phenomenon Nuttall-Smith does not explicitly explore (though he certainly describes it) is why people who love the simplicity of nature and holidaying on the land would go to the bother and trouble of making elaborate meals. He hints at an explanation: he refers to his excellent sunset cocktail snacks (a tin of good fish, candied nuts, “some oozy cheese … drizzled with Scotch bonnet-kissed honey”) as “the most important meal of the day,” because you have finally reached your destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is a great feeling. But there is a deeper reason people go to a lot of trouble to treat their companions to luxuries in reduced circumstances. Providing well in the wilderness, going out of your way to give pleasure to others, is a form of decency – what we used to call chivalry. Even here, the gifted quarterperson declares, with no running water or easy comforts at hand, in this pristine but still precarious spot where nothing comes easily and without effort, where we have been stripped to essentials, we can still show each other unnecessary kindness and unexpected generosity, just to honour the gift of one another’s company. That treat is always worth the prep.\n"

      "\n",
      "What are the short- and long-term health risks posed by air pollution from wildfires?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the short term, exposure to wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes and throat and cause runny noses, wheezing, phlegm production and headaches, according to Luisa Giles, an assistant professor in the school of kinesiology at the University of Fraser Valley, who focuses on the health effects of air pollution. It can cause some people to experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness, heart palpitations and impaired lung function, and can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s minimal research on any long-term health effects. But even so, Dr. Giles said, “an absence of evidence does not always indicate an absence of effect, therefore, it’s still recommended that individuals are cautious and aim to reduce their air pollution exposure where possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some initial research suggests exposure to air pollution from wildfires may be linked to increased risk of a range of health outcomes, including cancer and death from heart disease in older adults, and potentially dementia.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can you tell whether it’s safe to spend time outdoors?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Giles said a good place to start is checking the Air Quality Health Index for your area. This index is a scale from 1 to 10+ that provides an indicator of the health risk related to air quality and can be found on the Environment Canada website or provincial environment ministry sites. Alternatively, she suggests setting up Canada’s WeatherCAN app, which can alert you about what to do when the air quality is poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should you exercise when air quality is poor?\n",
      "\n",
      "When it’s smoky outside, exercising indoors is always a good first option, says Dr. Giles. Make sure, though, that your gym has its windows closed and is using HEPA filter, she advises. If the windows are open, or there isn’t a HEPA filter, then exercising indoors would be very similar to doing so outside. If you are exercising or spending time outdoors, however, you’ll still want to try and minimize exposure to air pollution, Dr. Giles says. You can do so, for example, by checking the Air Quality Health Index, and planning your outdoor activities to avoid times of the day when air pollution is worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can you do you protect yourself from health effects of wildfires?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pay attention to your exposure throughout the course of the day, and try to reduce it by, for example, keeping your windows closed (though try to not overheat) and using a HEPA filter if you have the means, Dr. Giles said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some areas may provide clean air shelters. These are libraries, community centres or schools where people can seek relief from smoky air. Health Canada published guidelines in 2020 for creating and managing clean air shelters during wildfire smoke events, which include ensuring they have HVAC systems that can filter fine particulate matter and are connected to an emergency power supply in case of power outages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Giles suggests you could also use a furnace filter with a higher MERV rating, such as 12 or 13, and keep your furnace fan running. Another option, she said, is wearing an N95 respirator if you are running errands or exercising wherever air quality is poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chris Carlsten, head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia and director of Vancouver Coastal Health’s Legacy for Airway Health program, said he, too, strongly recommends the use of air filters. This can be in the form of a small system in your bedroom, for example, or a large system for an entire building. Much of the advice on improving indoor air quality, such as using HEPA filters and regularly cleaning or changing filters on HVAC systems, will sound familiar after the past few years of COVID-19. (Though during wildfires, it’s not advisable to keep windows open.)\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to coping with the short-term health risks of exposure to wildfire smoke, it’s important to keep in mind that everyone will react differently, Dr. Carlsten said. Some people can exercise outside and not be bothered at all by it, while their peers don’t tolerate it well. So while those with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases ought to take greater precautions, he suggests letting your experience be your guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also recommends speaking with your health care provider about any concerns.\n",

      "\n",
      "The department said it is unusual for fires to cover this much of the country so early in the season. Warm and dry conditions are expected to increase the wildfire risk this month, with blazes expanding into Yukon and receding from Western Quebec into Central Ontario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Victoria Nurse, a meteorologist from the Ontario Storm Prediction Centre, said wildfires every year drive smoke into various parts of the country, but that it is rare to see it spread to this extent, particularly to the U.S. She said the unpleasant haze will continue to linger in Southern Ontario until at least the end of the week.\n",

      "“We’re not expecting any big rain soaking systems to come through unfortunately, so, looking at the forecast, fires could continue to grow,” Ms. Nurse said. “Depending on the wind direction changing, if we get that flow from the east that will take some of the smoke out of Southern Ontario and push it into Northern and Western Ontario.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The Binders are among 4,100 people still evacuated from their homes because of the wildfires that tore through wooded suburbs northwest of Halifax last weekend. Now contained, the blaze is one of five still burning in the province. In Southwestern Nova Scotia, the largest fire in the province’s history was still out of control but no longer growing after rainfall.\n",

Ms. Binder, three days overdue, had been walking and bouncing on an exercise ball the day before, willing the baby to come. Now, she hoped the baby would stay inside for just a little bit longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived at a friend’s place in Dartmouth, and three days later, Ms. Binder felt the familiar tightening waves of pain. Leo Arthur Binder, with plump cheeks and brown hair, was born at suppertime last Wednesday.\n",

      "The Binders’ home, which the couple said the city has informed them is intact, is located in one of the neighbourhoods where wildfires gutted more than 150 residences. It could be another two weeks before they will be allowed back home to assess the smoke damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, feeding, clothing and entertaining two young kids in a hotel suite with a newborn has been, at times, overwhelming. But Leo, who spends his days stretching, grunting, nursing and sleeping, has been a welcome distraction – somebody to gaze at and snuggle when it all seems like too much.

      "“We’re working very closely with our provincial, territorial and municipal partners and First Nations partners to ensure we provide support to those who have been evacuated,” Mr. Blair said. “All orders of government are working closely together including with our Indigenous partners to ensure a co-ordinated and effective response. It’s all hands on deck, and it’s around the clock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the amount of hectares burned so far exceeds recent memory and records, but, fortunately, there has been no loss of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, citing the impact on air quality in eastern North America, Mr. Blair, said, “By all measures, I think this is perhaps the worst year that we have experienced with wildfires as long as we have been keeping records.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said firefighters from South Africa have arrived in Edmonton, others have arrived from the United States, Australia and New Zealand and others are coming from France to help in Quebec, echoing the assistance that Canada has provided to other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defence Minister Anita Anand told the news conference that members of the Canadian Armed Forces are providing help in Alberta, Nova Scotia and in Quebec. “I’m here to offer all our resources if we have the capacity to provide them,” she told journalists.\n",

      "The Globe and Mail Editorial Board on how the eyes of the world are upon Ukraine: “Whatever its flaws, Ukraine is on the right side of history in its struggle against Russian aggression. It is defending not just its own sovereignty, but the principle that armed might cannot be allowed to redraw borders. It is defending not just its own citizens, but the foundation of international law that punishes those who commit war crimes, whether they are a private or a president. Ukrainians are dying to defend not just themselves, but also to defend our collective security.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Campbell Clark (The Globe and Mail) on how David Johnston’s testimony raises more questions about his report on foreign interference: “There wasn’t much chance going in that David Johnston was going to win over MPs reviewing his report on foreign interference. And when he left, he hadn’t provided much reassurance for Canadians that he got to the bottom of things. The government’s special rapporteur on foreign interference had to expect that his appearance at a Commons committee would bring more questions about his impartiality, and those of his staff. And it did. But there was also a new kind of grilling about the contents of Mr. Johnston’s report, and how he put together his findings.”\n",

      "Gary Mason (The Globe and Mail) on how B.C.’s drug decriminalization experiment is off to disastrous start: “The reality is, when it comes to dealing with the widespread scourge of drug addiction, we need to balance the needs of the individual with the broader needs of society. In many instances today, however, one side’s interests and needs are prevailing over the other’s. And in B.C. right now, drug users are taking advantage of a provincial strategy that is designed to help them, but is hurting innocent others in the process.”\n",
      "\n",
      "John Rapley (Contributed to The Globe and Mail) on how, when it comes to fighting inflation, central banks are getting way too confident: “Canada’s recent experience with inflation mirrors those of other developed economies. After falling for several months, it recently plateaued, with core inflation even ticking back up in places. Those who read me regularly will know that I’ve been predicting that for a while now and even though the Bank of Canada insists we will eventually return to 2 per cent inflation, I remain doubtful.”\n",

      "Allison Hanes (The Montreal Gazette) on what Paul Bernardo is doing in Quebec: “The commissioner of Corrections Canada has launched a review of Bernardo’s transfer to ensure it was taken with “the utmost care for public safety, victims’ rights and … the rule of law.” But that’s just one troubling issue that demands transparency. There are other questions that may go unanswered due to privacy rules that are still very much in the public interest. La Macaza, near Mont-Tremblant, is known for its sex offender treatment programs. Might Bernardo be looking for more fodder for his next bid at release? When last he applied for faint hope, his parole officer said Bernardo had made no progress and completed no programs since a hearing two years earlier. Will Bernardo seek treatment at La Macaza? If so, is there a risk of it backfiring?”\n",

      "\n",
      "Anyone living in areas affected by poor air quality faces potential health risks from breathing in wildfire smoke, according to experts who urge people to take precautions until conditions improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as Canada faces what could be the worst wildfire season in its history, there are growing concerns about how to grapple with the long-term health impact of worsening air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across parts of Southern and Eastern Ontario on Wednesday, outdoor recreational activities and recesses were cancelled and some hospitals saw a small uptick in people experiencing shortness of breath and other symptoms as smoke from faraway forest fires made the air increasingly hazardous to breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These levels are so high that really everybody is at risk to some extent,” said Tom Kovesi, a pediatric respirologist at CHEO in Ottawa. “Even if you have no underlying health conditions, being exposed to this level can cause lung irritation, coughing, shortness of breath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Latest updates on wildfires in Canada today: Quebec’s wildfire season already the worst on record\n",
      "\n",
      "The high levels of pollution in the air prompted Environment Canada to issue a special air quality statement on Wednesday, warning that smoke can have an impact on health “even at low concentrations.” Poor air quality is expected to continue into the weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some groups face higher health risks than others: people with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other lung problems; people who are pregnant; children; and individuals with other underlying medical conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even people who don’t face an increased risk may experience challenges breathing when the air quality reaches dangerous levels, experts say. Michael Fitzpatrick, a respirologist and chief of staff of the Kingston Health Sciences Centre, said many symptoms, such as an increase in coughing or a scratchy throat, will likely resolve themselves and not cause any permanent damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Smoky air hangs over the Toronto skyline, as seen from the CN Tower, on June 6.CARLOS OSORIO/Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "But wildfire smoke also contains high levels of fine particulate matter that can be absorbed into the bloodstream, causing inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those microparticulates can get absorbed into the blood via the lungs. There’s less known about the long-term effects of exposure,” said Anna Gunz, a pediatric intensive care doctor at the Children’s Hospital at London Health Sciences Centre. “People might not necessarily be aware.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, there’s research indicating that particulate matter from wildfires can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular events, Dr. Kovesi said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts advise higher-risk individuals to take immediate steps to protect themselves when the risk level of the air quality health index increases. According to the index, levels of 4 to 6 are considered moderate risk and vulnerable individuals are urged to reduce or reschedule outdoor activities. Levels of 7 to 10 are considered high risk and anything above 10 is considered very high risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parts of Ontario, including Hamilton and Ottawa, were above 10 on Wednesday, although smoke affected millions living in the Greater Toronto Area and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several ways people can protect themselves when the air quality health risks go up. Staying inside with doors and windows closed and using an air filter can reduce inhalation of fine particulate matter. If no air filter is available, an air conditioner can also be used to reduce some of the fine particles in the air. If people have to spend time outside, such as those who work outdoors, high-quality masks can help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kovesi said he hopes the air quality improves in the next few days. But, as wildfires and other climate-related disasters become more common, it’s imperative for Canada to do more to protect the planet and reduce the health consequences of climate change, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a lung specialist, you don’t start off your life being very political, but this is a political and a societal issue,” he said.\n"

      "\n",
      "New Yorkers were gripped by the worst urban air quality in the world Thursday, and Americans could face days or even weeks of smoky siege from the drifting haze of unrelenting Canadian wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hundreds of community parks, ballfields and other outdoor spaces from Canada to North Carolina sat empty as air quality readings in many areas ranged from unhealthy to hazardous. The low-pressure system adrift over Maine and Nova Scotia that has helped funnel the ashen air will probably be \"hanging around at least for the next few days,” National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Ramsey said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions are likely to remain unhealthy until the wind direction changes or the fires are doused, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since the fires are raging, they’re really large, they’re probably going to continue for weeks,\" Ramsey said. \"It’s really just going be all about the wind shift.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news, AccuWeather reports, is that parts of the Northeast could see modest air quality improvements through the day Thursday, although it will take until Friday or Friday night for significant improvement in some locations. The bad news is some of the most dense smoke may shift west toward Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Detroit, AccuWeather said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developments:\n",
      "\n",
      "◾ The air quality monitoring website iqair.com had New York City at the top of its global list Thursday. Detroit rose as high as third before falling back into the 20s.\n",
      "\n",
      "◾ Friday will be a remote-instruction day for the more than 1 million students attending New York City public schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "◾ Authorities warned residents across much of the Northeast to stay inside and limit or avoid outdoor activities Thursday, extending “Code Red” alerts in some places for a third-straight day\n",

      "Biden's advice to Americans about wildfire smoke: 'Stay safe,' seek local guidance\n",
      "\n",
      "President Joe Biden encouraged Americans suffering through air pollution from the Canadian wildfires to seek local government guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very important that affected communities listen to the guidance of their state and local officials from this point forward,\" Biden told reporters at the start of his joint press conference with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the White House. \"Check on one another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The president said that Americans can keep up to date on the air quality across the country at the website AirNow.gov.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a more detailed written statement released Thursday, Biden said he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about adding more U.S. firefighters in Canada to join the 600 American firefighters which include \"hot shots and jumper crews\" already on the ground there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have directed the National Interagency Fire Center to respond promptly to Canadian requests for additional firefighters and fire suppression assets such as air tankers,\" Biden said. \"I’ve asked Secretary of Transportation Buttigieg to keep me informed about his progress in ensuring that we proactively manage the air traffic implications of the deteriorated air quality based on lessons learned from prior incidents.\"\n",

      "The best thing to do when air quality outside is unhealthy due to wildfire smoke is stay indoors, but what if you have to go out? Is there a best time of day to do it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts say, not really, and the answer can vary depending on a specific location, weather, topography and other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In areas of the East Coast that are impacted by the Canadian wildfires, the source of the smoke pollution is constant, so the air quality levels aren’t changing all that much with the time of day, Prof. Valentina Aquila, an atmospheric scientist at American University said.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have to go out, “rather than suggesting an hour, I would actually suggest to wear a mask,” Aquila said. “For wildfires, although smoke levels may fluctuate throughout the day, there is no safe time, so outside activity, especially strenuous activity, should be minimized,” Michelle Bell, a professor with the Yale School of the Environment, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, don’t try to go for a jog at any time of day when air quality is unhealthy, and if you have to go out for any other reason, keep it short and put on a high-filtration mask, experts say.\n",

      "Pets can't wear masks outdoors to protect them from the smoke, but many need to go outdoors. It's important to keep monitoring their health and try to keep them inside as much as possible, said Dr. Aly Cohen with the Cornell University Riney Canine Health Center. Some breeds of dogs, called short-muzzle breeds, already have higher rates of respiratory issues, including bulldogs, Boston terriers and Cavalier King Charles spaniels. Pet birds and horses also are at higher risk, Cohen said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Older adults, pregnant women, young children and people with chronic heart and respiratory conditions are more likely to get sick if they breathe in wildfire smoke. But the CDC says even healthy adults can also experience coughing, breathing issues, stinging eyes, scratchy throat, runny nose, irritated sinuses, chest pain, headaches, asthma attacks, fatigue and fast heartbeat.

      "\"This increase in air pollution is new to many (people),\" he said. \"Their bodies are confused about what’s happening. Please pay attention to even the slightest things, including a headache, eye redness, and even some itchiness or a rash. ... Don’t ignore any symptoms.\"\n",

It uses color-coded categories to describe air quality, which groups of people may be affected and steps that can be taken to reduce exposure to air pollution. It’s also used as the basis for air quality forecasts and current air quality reporting. Metro areas with a population of more than 350,000 are required to report the daily AQI, and you can find the daily AQI on AirNow and on state and local agency websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "State and local air quality experts provide forecasts across the nation. In most areas, AQI forecasts focus on the next day. For ozone, an AQI forecast focuses on the period when average eight-hour ozone concentrations are expected to be the highest. For particulate matter, the forecast predicts the average 24-hour concentration for the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do the AQI numbers mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "The AQI is measured on a scale of 0 to 500. The higher the AQI values, the greater the level of air pollution and health concern there is, according to AirNow.gov. Conversely, the lower the AQI values, the air quality is more satisfactory and the health risks are lower. A measure of 50 and under represents good air quality. Anything above 300 is considered \"hazardous\" and will usually prompt a health warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA determines the AQI values based on five major air pollutants which are regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.\n",

      "More than 400 blazes burning across Canada have left 20,000 people displaced. The U.S. has sent more than 600 firefighters and equipment to Canada. A primary culprit for fouling U.S. air is the 150 fires burning in south-central Quebec, a majority of which were not contained. A stalled high-pressure system over the northern Plains and the stationary low-pressure system over eastern Canada has produced a \"steering\" wind from north to south, sending thick plumes of smoke into the Northeast, Middle Atlantic and Ohio Valley, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fires are mostly in remote, wooded areas − and since most of Canada's firefighting focus is on saving homes, the blazes are likely to continue burning into the summer, Anderson said.\n",

      "\"So get used to these episodes of smoke and haze through the summer,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unusually hot, dry weather that wouldn’t stop gave rise to the wildfires. Most were ignited by lightning, experts say. A warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, according to Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the atmospheric sciences department at the University of Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The month of May was just off the charts, record warm in much of Canada,” said Eric James, a modeling expert with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science at the University of Colorado. “I don’t remember (Canadian) fires of this scale in the last 10 years.\"\n",

Every summer and fall, wildfires in America wreck homes, air quality and lives. While many of the current fires in Canada were caused by lightning that landed on dry forests, here in the States, lightning is rarely the culprit. An astonishing 80 percent are caused by human carelessness. That means they could have been prevented with smarter behavior in our increasingly flammable wild lands.

      "\n",
      "“In coming years, we will have to reflect seriously on how we can equip ourselves to deal with this new reality,” said Mr. Trudeau.

      "Anyone living in areas affected by poor air quality faces potential health risks from breathing in wildfire smoke, according to experts who urge people to take precautions until conditions improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as Canada faces what could be the worst wildfire season in its history, there are growing concerns about how to grapple with the long-term health impact of worsening air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across parts of Southern and Eastern Ontario on Wednesday, outdoor recreational activities and recesses were cancelled and some hospitals saw a small uptick in people experiencing shortness of breath and other symptoms as smoke from faraway forest fires made the air increasingly hazardous to breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These levels are so high that really everybody is at risk to some extent,” said Tom Kovesi, a pediatric respirologist at CHEO in Ottawa. “Even if you have no underlying health conditions, being exposed to this level can cause lung irritation, coughing, shortness of breath.”\n",

      "The high levels of pollution in the air prompted Environment Canada to issue a special air quality statement on Wednesday, warning that smoke can have an impact on health “even at low concentrations.” Poor air quality is expected to continue into the weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some groups face higher health risks than others: people with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other lung problems; people who are pregnant; children; and individuals with other underlying medical conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even people who don’t face an increased risk may experience challenges breathing when the air quality reaches dangerous levels, experts say. Michael Fitzpatrick, a respirologist and chief of staff of the Kingston Health Sciences Centre, said many symptoms, such as an increase in coughing or a scratchy throat, will likely resolve themselves and not cause any permanent damage.\n",

      "Open this photo in gallery: Smoky air hangs over the Toronto skyline, as seen from the CN Tower, on June 6.CARLOS OSORIO/Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "But wildfire smoke also contains high levels of fine particulate matter that can be absorbed into the bloodstream, causing inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those microparticulates can get absorbed into the blood via the lungs. There’s less known about the long-term effects of exposure,” said Anna Gunz, a professor at Western University’s Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry and a pediatric intensive care doctor at the Children’s Hospital at London Health Sciences Centre. “People might not necessarily be aware,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, there’s research indicating that particulate matter from wildfires can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular events, Dr. Kovesi said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts advise higher-risk individuals to take immediate steps to protect themselves when the risk level of the air quality health index increases. According to the index, levels of 4 to 6 are considered moderate risk and vulnerable individuals are urged to reduce or reschedule outdoor activities. Levels of 7 to 10 are considered high risk and anything above 10 is considered very high risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parts of Ontario, including Hamilton and Ottawa, were above 10 on Wednesday, although smoke affected millions living in the Greater Toronto Area and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several ways people can protect themselves when the air quality health risks go up. Staying inside with doors and windows closed and using an air filter can reduce inhalation of fine particulate matter. If no air filter is available, an air conditioner can also be used to reduce some of the fine particles in the air. If people have to spend time outside, such as those who work outdoors, high-quality masks can help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kovesi said he hopes the air quality improves in the next few days. But, as wildfires and other climate-related disasters become more common, it’s imperative for Canada to do more to protect the planet and reduce the health consequences of climate change, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a lung specialist, you don’t start off your life being very political, but this is a political and a societal issue,” he said.\n"

      "['Ian Brown'] 2023-06-07 09:00:00-04:00 Open this photo in gallery: A really creamy spinach dip that features in the book Cook it Wild by Chris Nuttal-Smith.Maya Visnyei/Clarkson Potter\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s begin our discussion of Chris Nuttall-Smith’s new cookbook, Cook It Wild: Sensational Prep-Ahead Meals for Camping, Cabins and the Great Outdoors (Penguin, $40), with a brief appreciation of quartermasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scouts Canada offers new hotline for all your camping questions\n",
      "\n",
      "Buy it, love it: Camping gear that Globe staffers can’t live without\n",
      "\n",
      "In a land army, the quartermaster is the soldier who supervises supplies and provisions. On a canoe trip or a hike or a back-country ski trip or even an RV excursion, the quartermaster/mistress is the hard-working keener who organizes the food. They are detail-oriented and can be punctilious. You don’t want to be the camper who forgot the valve for the WhisperLite stove when you’re halfway down the Alsek River in the middle of the Yukon’s Kluane wilderness in a torrential downpour and the quartermaster wants to make tea. Not to mention any names or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nuttall-Smith, a highly accomplished journalist, food writer (formerly restaurant critic at The Globe and Mail) and resident judge on Top Chef Canada, qualifies as an ultraimaginative quartermaster, and even an easy-going one – as long as you don’t keep opening and closing his all-important drinks cooler, thereby melting the ice that is preserving the slushy negronis he made back in the city and hauled all the way up to God-knows-where.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crux of it all? A make-ahead success plan\n",
      "\n",
      "The central premise of Cook It Wild is deceptively simple: anyone can eat fabulously in the wildest of places, as long as you prepare ahead of time, thereby reducing the work you have to do fireside after a long day of paddling/skiing/hiking/driving. There is nary a hot dog nor can of baked beans nor freeze-dried giblet to be seen in Cook It Wild. Its “empowering make-ahead, prep-ahead system,” as Nuttall-Smith describes it, is based on five key principles: Chop Ahead, Mix Ahead, Cook Ahead, Seal Ahead and Freeze Ahead, in that order. Eggs on a camping trip? No problem: whisk them at home and freeze them; they’ll last two days in a cooler. (Or pack them in doubled-up egg cartons, and don’t freeze them.)\n",
      "\n",
      "To help you achieve these noble, clarifying goals and eat like a fireside trencher, the first third of Cook It Wild is devoted to extra-culinary tricks every camper needs to know. These include how to properly pack a cooler (block ice on the bottom, and fill the air gap under the lid with a towel or refreezable ice packs); how to light, build and manage a cooking fire; how to make excellent coffee on said fire; which cheeses travel best; how to string your food in a tree, etc., etc., etc. Nuttall-Smith even provides diagrams of “the one and only knot you need to know.” He’s the greatest Scoutmaster who ever lived, except that, unlike any of the scoutmasters I ever knew, he’s also a terrific chef.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each recipe lists special equipment needed and the number of people it serves – standard cookbook fare – but also the weight of its ingredients and an emoji-like symbol denoting the kind of camping for which the recipe is best suited (whether it’s winter camping, roadside in an RV or glamping in a yurt). Nuttall-Smith aims to demystify the daunting food organizing that scares so many off camping, while maximizing your holiday leisure, whether you are scaling Mount Robson or picnicking in your backyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, as a quartermaster at heart, Nuttall-Smith is occasionally a stickler, as he should be. He insists you buy a fine mesh strainer (and then cut off its handle, to save space) for filtering food scraps (which you must pack out) from your dishwater. He doesn’t insist on his packing plan, as long as you have one, but he clearly favours packing by meal type (all breakfasts in one bag, ditto lunches and dinners, cocktail snacks in another, and so on) rather than by day (which entails more cooler opening and closing).\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: A recipe for caramalized shallot-cheese fondue.Maya Visnyei/The Associated Press\n",
      "\n",
      "As someone who once went mountain climbing with nothing but freeze-dried food, which in turn caused Chernobylean clouds of gas to erupt from my guide as I followed him up vertical cliff walls, let me say this: Cook It Wild is very high-end camp eating. Instant Caramelized Shallot-Cheese Fondue, over a WhisperLite stove no less, on a long, energy-sapping back-packing trek? Yes, please. Powdermilk biscuits (baked in a Dutch oven buried in the ashes of a fire), or a phenomenal corn-cheddar-and-green-onion skillet cake for breakfast? Yes again. (Freeze the feta, so you don’t have to carry the heavy brine.) The book’s sides are original and delectable and also easy: puff-and-serve chapatis! Risottos! Enfoiled mushroom roasts! And then there’s campfire paella. “No other outdoors dish says party quite like paella,” Nuttall-Smith writes, adding that it is “the showstoppiest of showstoppers.” He proffers three versions, one of them vegan. Yes, you need an open fire to cook them, and a cooler to keep the squid and chicken and shrimp from spoiling, and a large heavy skillet or a paella pan. But it all fits in a canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "But make no mistake: Eating well in the simplicity of the wild takes more work than eating well just about anywhere else, in part because you prepare everything twice: once At Home (Nuttall-Smith divides every recipe this way) and again At Camp, ditto.\n",
      "\n",
      "The secret ingredient: A show of kindness\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent an entire recent Saturday shopping for and then cooking a luxurious Cook It Wild meal for six. (Which I then reheated on my backyard barbecue, as a simulation.) The meal was dinner-party worthy. Nuttall-Smith’s Freakishly Delicious Olives, Warmed by the Fire and marinated in smashed garlic and orange peel, were even better for having sat a day in their carefully sealed Baggie. His Silky Day-Glo Hummus, whirled from a roasted beet, was first rated A+ by my guests, and then A++. Olive Oil Pistachios (shelled and gently heated in same) got a look or two – ”Why heat pistachios in oil?” my wife, a pistachio fiend, asked – but it’s a subtler pistachio, a calmer nut that has had some therapy and is more amenable to conversation. (They were even better four days later.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fresh Lime Margaritas (19 ounces of weight in the drinks cooler) that Nuttall-Smith claims will keep two weeks frozen and two days thawed are so delicious they will actually only last one night. But the star of the evening, the dish one of my guests (a seasoned canoeist and quartermaster) made again the very next day for his children and grandchildren, was the Really Creamy Spinach. It weighed nearly two pounds and demanded nearly an hour of prep and cooking before I plopped it into its resealable freezer bag, but it was definitive creamed spinach. And I haven’t even mentioned the book’s desserts, none of which – for once – are the hideous degradation known as smores.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one phenomenon Nuttall-Smith does not explicitly explore (though he certainly describes it) is why people who love the simplicity of nature and holidaying on the land would go to the bother and trouble of making elaborate meals. He hints at an explanation: he refers to his excellent sunset cocktail snacks (a tin of good fish, candied nuts, “some oozy cheese … drizzled with Scotch bonnet-kissed honey”) as “the most important meal of the day,” because you have finally reached your destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that is a great feeling. But there is a deeper reason people go to a lot of trouble to treat their companions to luxuries in reduced circumstances. Providing well in the wilderness, going out of your way to give pleasure to others, is a form of decency – what we used to call chivalry. Even here, the gifted quarterperson declares, with no running water or easy comforts at hand, in this pristine but still precarious spot where nothing comes easily and without effort, where we have been stripped to essentials, we can still show each other unnecessary kindness and unexpected generosity, just to honour the gift of one another’s company. That treat is always worth the prep.\n"

      "\n",
      "“We haven’t won the fight yet,” he said in a news conference. Nearly 14,000 people were under evacuation orders in Quebec on Saturday, the minister said, with most of them not expected to be able to return home before Tuesday, when much needed rain is in the forecast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bonnardel said 861 personnel, including Canadian Armed Forces and foreign firefighters, were at work fighting 37 blazes out of the 121 raging across the province’s “intensive zone,” covering most of the inhabited territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, wildfires have burned more than 700,000 hectares in the zone, which is more than 300 times the average at this time of year for the past decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday’s national snapshot from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre showed a growing number of out-of-control fires on the West Coast, as hot, dry weather fed flames and led to a fresh round of evacuation orders and alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "With 2,414 fires recorded and 4.5 million hectares burned this year as of Friday evening, according to the centre, this has been the most active start to a wildfire season on record.\n",

      "”Damage to the road and instability of the slope above the highway means this closure is likely to last beyond the fire itself,” the ministry said. A four-hour detour route is established by way of industrial forest roads, but its use is recommended for essential travel only, isolating communities on the Island’s west coast like Tofino.\n",

The New York Times called it racist, and it indisputably was. Donald Trump, then president of the United States, was even asked about it. Said Trump: “I’m surprised. I was more surprised when I saw the number of times.” That, really, was the last time we were big news in the United States. Until this week, that is, when wildfires in Canada started to make it hard for Americans to breathe. So, for the first time in years, the media in the U.S. started to paying attention to us.\n",

      "Article content Watching the foreign firefighters arrive was an emotional experience, at least for this writer. And then, a question occurred: why do we need firefighters from other countries? Canada has enough firefighters of our own, don’t we? No, we don’t. And all of us are to blame for that – governments, for bad decisions, and voters, for letting them get away with those bad decisions. Photo by Adrian Wyld / The Canadian Press Here’s a summary of Canada’s firefighting capacity and it’s not a pretty picture: – The Government of Canada provides firefighting funding through different programs. Right now, just Alberta and Nova Scotia are receiving federal assistance and Quebec has applied for it. The Trudeau government has said they want to create a “Centre for Excellence for Wildland Fires,” but they haven’t done that yet. They also want to set up something called “WildFireSat,” to use satellites to track wildfires, but they haven’t done that yet either.\n",

      "Article content – In 2021, Ontario budgeted $100 million to fight forest fires but spent $238 million. For years, and under successive governments, the province has been struggling to recruit firefighters. Seven hundred are hired every year, but it’s still (clearly) not enough. Photo by handout / THE CANADIAN PRESS – Quebec has boosted its Public Safety and Fire Prevention budget by $9 million to $86.7 million. But given this week’s events, that’s obviously not enough either. The Quebec government has admitted it only has the resources to fight 30 out of the 160 forest fires that are currently burning. And it only has 240 full-time firefighters. – Last month, Alberta lost more than two million acres – that’s 1.5 million football fields – to fire. Danielle Smith’s UCP government has made a bad situation worse. Her government cut firefighting programs in 2019, including the Aerial Rapattack rapid response team, and closed 26 of the province’s 127 wildfire lookout towers. More cuts in 2021 resulted in the loss of permanent staff, and Smith has overseen funding drop by $30 million since 2019.\n",

      "Article content – British Columbia, however, has spent more – 2022 saw the largest investment in wildfire management in the province’s history, which included a transformation into a year-round service. The NDP government’s 2022 budget included $517 million over three years in new funding, too – which includes $145 million for the BC Wildfire Service and Emergency Management BC. The province presently has about 1,100 firefighters. Photo by HO-Mike Coates / THE CANADIAN PRESS – In Manitoba and Yukon, the firefighting budget went up in 2023. In Saskatchewan, it has gone down. In some Atlantic provinces, like New Brunswick, it’s hard to find information about the true picture. But in Nova Scotia – whose Halifax was literally on fire last month – firefighting spending is down from the previous year. Same in Newfoundland, where the fire suppression budget went down, not up. All in all, our ability to prevent and fight wildfires is not where it needs to be. With a warming planet, the situation is obviously going to get a lot worse, and we’re just not ready. Yes, some provinces (Ontario, British Columbia) are spending more. Yes, some provinces (Alberta, Nova Scotia) are foolishly spending less. And, across the board, we don’t have enough firefighters. But, this week, we have caught the attention of the world – and not in a good way. Time to make some changes, Canada. The future is coming, and it’s going to be a hot one.\n",

      "With more significant fires becoming the new normal, even people not directly threatened are concerned with what to do about the spread of wildfire smoke. With new threats emerging for areas that have not previously dealt with smoke conditions, you may find yourself preparing for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Picking up a dedicated air purifier or getting new filters for your central air conditioner are the most effective ways you can help protect those in your home. (That includes pets—the American Veterinary Medical Association recommends keeping an eye out for specific animal health issues related to wildfire smoke). But you can also take cheap, simple, and immediate steps using stuff you probably already own, such as a mop and a washing machine. Here’s what we recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Invest in an air purifier\n",
      "\n",
      "First, consider a true-HEPA air purifier. We have an extensive guide to air purifiers, but the basic facts are these: According to the EPA, wildfire smoke predominantly consists of particles that are smaller than 10 microns. And true-HEPA air filters are exceptionally good at removing particles of that size from the air. Our top picks, the Coway AP-1512HH and nearly identical Coway Airmega 200M, are well-priced, superb performers, and reliable. They’re powerful enough for rooms up to 350 square feet, which includes most bedrooms and living rooms. The Blueair Blue Pure 211+, our pick for larger spaces, can rapidly clear the air in bigger rooms and open-floorplan homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Coway has been our top pick air purifier since 2015, but in recent years several companies have produced models that approach our high standards, and we’ve added a few new options to include a wider range of price points and aesthetics. These include the Winix 5500-2, the Winix AM90, the Blueair Blue Pure 311 Auto, the Blueair Blue Pure 211+, Levoit Core 300 and the Levoit Core 400S.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recommend running an air purifier on high for an hour the first time you turn the machine on. That’ll clear the air quickly by passing the entire volume of air in the room through the filter four to six times. Thereafter, keeping the machine on low or automatic will keep the air clear. Just run it continuously. Noise is usually not an issue; on lower settings, the purifiers we recommend are virtually silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "If purifiers are scarce, try this How to DIY an Air Purifier If your air quality is bad and you don’t have an air purifier, an HVAC filter taped to a box fan is better than nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upgrade your HVAC Filters\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have central air and heating, you may consider a different and cheaper option: upgrading to one of the furnace and air-conditioning filters we recommend. The EPA recommends filters with a rating of at least MERV 13, or, “as high a rating as your system fan and filter slot can accommodate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "MERV stands for “minimum efficiency reporting value,” and it is a measure of how well a central-air filter removes particulates from the air. Medium-MERV filters provide much more filtration than the basic MERV 1–4 filters with central-air systems, which capture only pollutants visible to the naked eye, such as pet hair and dust bunnies, but not fine particulates like smoke. If you’re not sure which type you have, these basic filters often come included with the equipment, they’re your least expensive filter-replacement option, and they typically look like a see-through mesh of blue or green string.\n",
      "\n",
      "The medium-MERV filters we recommend, rated MERV 8 to 13, are typically an opaque white, felt-like in texture, and pleated like an accordion. In our guide to furnace and air-conditioning filters, our recommendation is a MERV 12 filter from Nordic Pure. A six-pack typically costs about $40. If they’re not available, we also have MERV 12–equivalent recommendations from Honeywell and Filtrete. This is below the MERV 13 ideal in the EPA’s 2022 guidance; the overall message is really to go with the highest level of filtration that can fit and function in your system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher-rated MERV filters can put strain on one of several air-moving pieces of equipment, depending on your system’s age and design. (Read our detailed reporting on the matter in our main filters guide.) Smoky conditions will clog the filters in as little as half the recommended replacement cycle (usually three months), so we suggest simply replacing the filters once the fires are over. Wildfires or not, if your system is more than 15 or 20 years old, it may not be up to the extra effort of medium-MERV filtration. In that case we recommend buying a portable air purifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "For clear info on unclear air The Best Home Air Quality Monitor Get reliable, accurate air quality information with these apps and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep your place clean\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of whether you go with the above recommendations, you have other simple, essentially free steps to take to reduce the problem of smoke in your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may seem obvious, but close your windows. Most of the time, outside air contains fewer particulates than indoor air, so open windows are a good idea. But in wildfire conditions, that isn't the case. Closing your windows will help keep smoke from entering your home in the first place. Minimize entrances and exits through exterior doors, and use any double-door configuration you have (like an attached garage, separate basement entrance, or vestibule) to isolate smoke upon entry and prevent a full waft of it from infiltrating the living space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even fine smoke particles eventually drop out of the air and settle on surfaces, including floors. We recommend damp-mopping your floors to pick them up rather than vacuuming, which can simply blow them back up into the air. Our picks for dust mop and wet mop do a great job (I use both) and are inexpensive, durable, ergonomic, and washable. But any mop you own will work. For the record, damp-mopping (with the mop lightly wetted, as opposed to wet-mopping, with the mop saturated) won’t damage wood floors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smoke particles also settle on your clothes, skin, and bed. If you’ve spent time outdoors in the smoke, change into clean clothes when you get home. Wash your sheets more often than normal, too. Take a quick shower before you go to bed. And after the smoke clears and the fires subside, clean everything, change all your filters, and breathe easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wear a respirator\n",
      "\n",
      "Wearing a mask can help you protect yourself while these longer term fixes are underway. We researched relevant products in the best respirator mask for smoke and dust. Our testing identified specific models of N95 respirators we found to be versatile in fit, reliable in performance, and widely available once the initial wave of shortages early in the Covid pandemic passed.\n"

      "[] 2023-06-09 22:02:14-04:00 A town in western Alberta was under an evacuation order late Friday due to an out-of-control wildfire – its second such order this spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local officials issued the evacuation for Edson and parts of Yellowhead County.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re still evacuating the community and evacuating the hospital,” said Edson mayor Kevin Zahara.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All things considered, so far so good – but the next 72 hours are going to be critical for us. We have a lot of warm temperatures in the forecast and it’s windy here right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s going to be dependent on those winds and the weather on how this fire behaves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta government officials said the fire burning near the community of about 8,400 jumped fire guards and moved closer to populated areas, including the town. They warned that there could be impacts to roads and highways if the fire crossed the guards and blocks evacuation routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because that fire is so out of control, some of the forestry crews have had to back off,” said Luc Mercier, chief administrative officer for Yellowhead County, in a video statement on one of the town’s Facebook pages. “They can’t fight that fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mercier said the fire could threaten Highway 16, the main east-west route in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have significant concerns with egress along Highway 16 in the coming days,” he said. “The next 36 hours will be paramount with the winds coming forward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Edson area, about 190 kilometres west of Edmonton, saw four new fire starts on Friday, said Mercier.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unprecedented start to the wildfire season led Alberta to bring in a provincewide state of emergency on May 6. At one point, about 29,000 people were out of their homes in various communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state of emergency was lifted last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday afternoon, before the evacuation order was issued for Edson and the surrounding area, about 3,500 Albertans remained out of their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evacuation buses were leaving from three points in Yellowhead County and five in Edson. An evacuation centre was being set up in Edmonton’s Expo Centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zahara said there had been little threat in the area as recently as four days ago. Hot weather and high winds put a stop to that.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“It’s really important people adhere to the evacuation order.”\n",

      "['Globe Staff'] 2023-06-11 13:48:14-04:00 The latest on wildfires and wildfire smoke in Canada The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre said there were 427 fires burning on Saturday in 10 provinces and two territories. There are 206 out of control fires. More than 43,000 square kilometres have burned in Canada so far this year, making 2023 the second-worst year for wildfires on record. That’s before the hottest months of the year have even begun. In 2014, more than 46,000 square kilometres burned, the most ever in a single year. At the current pace, that total is expected to be passed this weekend. Follow updates from across the country below.\n",

      "Article content Watching the foreign firefighters arrive was an emotional experience, at least for this writer. And then, a question occurred: why do we need firefighters from other countries? Canada has enough firefighters of our own, don’t we? No, we don’t. And all of us are to blame for that – governments, for bad decisions, and voters, for letting them get away with those bad decisions. Photo by Adrian Wyld / The Canadian Press Here’s a summary of Canada’s firefighting capacity and it’s not a pretty picture: – The Government of Canada provides firefighting funding through different programs. Right now, just Alberta and Nova Scotia are receiving federal assistance and Quebec has applied for it. The Trudeau government has said they want to create a “Centre for Excellence for Wildland Fires,” but they haven’t done that yet. They also want to set up something called “WildFireSat,” to use satellites to track wildfires, but they haven’t done that yet either.\n",

      "Article content – In 2021, Ontario budgeted $100 million to fight forest fires but spent $238 million. For years, and under successive governments, the province has been struggling to recruit firefighters. Seven hundred are hired every year, but it’s still (clearly) not enough. Photo by handout / THE CANADIAN PRESS – Quebec has boosted its Public Safety and Fire Prevention budget by $9 million to $86.7 million. But given this week’s events, that’s obviously not enough either. The Quebec government has admitted it only has the resources to fight 30 out of the 160 forest fires that are currently burning. And it only has 240 full-time firefighters. – Last month, Alberta lost more than two million acres – that’s 1.5 million football fields – to fire. Danielle Smith’s UCP government has made a bad situation worse. Her government cut firefighting programs in 2019, including the Aerial Rapattack rapid response team, and closed 26 of the province’s 127 wildfire lookout towers. More cuts in 2021 resulted in the loss of permanent staff, and Smith has overseen funding drop by $30 million since 2019.\n",

      "Article content – British Columbia, however, has spent more – 2022 saw the largest investment in wildfire management in the province’s history, which included a transformation into a year-round service. The NDP government’s 2022 budget included $517 million over three years in new funding, too – which includes $145 million for the BC Wildfire Service and Emergency Management BC. The province presently has about 1,100 firefighters. Photo by HO-Mike Coates / THE CANADIAN PRESS – In Manitoba and Yukon, the firefighting budget went up in 2023. In Saskatchewan, it has gone down. In some Atlantic provinces, like New Brunswick, it’s hard to find information about the true picture. But in Nova Scotia – whose Halifax was literally on fire last month – firefighting spending is down from the previous year. Same in Newfoundland, where the fire suppression budget went down, not up. All in all, our ability to prevent and fight wildfires is not where it needs to be. With a warming planet, the situation is obviously going to get a lot worse, and we’re just not ready. Yes, some provinces (Ontario, British Columbia) are spending more. Yes, some provinces (Alberta, Nova Scotia) are foolishly spending less. And, across the board, we don’t have enough firefighters. But, this week, we have caught the attention of the world – and not in a good way. Time to make some changes, Canada. The future is coming, and it’s going to be a hot one.\n",

      "['Gail Collins', 'Bret Stephens'] 2023-06-12 00:00:00 But speaking of forest fires, shall we get to that latest Trump indictment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Gail: We’re obviously in history-making territory — first former president indicted in a criminal case brought by the federal government. And this one, which involves trying to stash away official papers he’d been told were government property, is certainly a classic Trump combination of shocking and stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bret: Or sinister and self-serving. I’m still not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gail: Wow, the pictures of those boxes of classified documents piled up around the toilet …\n",
      "\n",
      "Bret: Really puts a new spin on the term “anal retentive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gail: I did sorta hope we’d start the cosmic Trump prosecutions with one of the other big charges — trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election by pressing the Georgia secretary of state to “find” more votes and encouraging the Jan. 6 insurrection do seem more … important.\n",
      "\n",
      "You?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bret: Three thoughts, Gail. The first is that Jack Smith, the special counsel, has produced irrefutable proof that Trump knew that he possessed, as the former president himself put it, “secret information” that he could have declassified when he was in office but didn’t. That may be about as close to a slam dunk, legally speaking, as we’re ever going to get in a case like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gail: True, but I want shockingly terrible besides terribly illegal. Go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bret: The second thought is that a special counsel appointed by President Biden’s attorney general is bringing a criminal case against the president’s presumptive opponent in next year’s election. To many Republicans, this will smack of a bald attempt to politicize justice and criminalize politics — the very thing Trump was accused of doing in his first impeachment. Trump will surely use this to his political advantage and, as the writer Damon Linker noted in a perceptive guest essay last week, will probably see his primary poll numbers jump yet again.\n"

Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair says 431 wildfires are burning across Canada and more than 200 are out of control. More than 47,000 square kilometres have burned so far this year. Blair says it marks Canada’s worst wildfire season of the 21st century. About 5,000 firefighting personnel are deployed and hundreds more from Chile, Costa Rica, Spain and Portugal are to arrive in the coming days. Follow updates from across the country below.\n",

      "Kowalewski is a fire officer in France, and she was seconded to work with the E.U.’s emergency coordination centre. She’s temporarily based at the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in Winnipeg, where she is overseeing all of the logistics for the European firefighters. There are officers there from other countries that have pitched in to help, including Costa Rica and South Africa, she said.\n",

      "On Sunday, that sentiment was shared by authorities in Quebec. Maïté Blanchette Vézina, the province’s natural resources minister, told reporters that firefighters had begun to attack a fire threatening the Atikamekw community of Obedjiwan, rather than just respond to it. That was thanks to help of fire crews from other jurisdictions, including the team from France, she said.\n",

How fires ignite – for instance, from lightning strikes or human causes – is often also considered.

      "Canada is taking wildfire fighting to the final frontier at the end of the decade with three satellites – their high-tech infrared sensors focused on monitoring the size, spread and speed of the country’s blazes and smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operation WildFireSat is set to be the first time a country deploys satellites specifically geared at wildfire monitoring. A collaboration between Natural Resources Canada, the Canadian Space Agency and Environment and Climate Change Canada, the mission promises to streamline firefighting resources, increase evacuation warning time and deepen scientific understanding of wildfire behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2029, the $170-million initiative will launch three satellites that will measure the “fire radiative power” emitted by wildfires. This measurement means wildfire services can calculate fire intensity and rate of spread, in real-time, precisely when fires are most dangerous. It also means they can measure smoke emitted by the fire, more accurately predicting air quality conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project will be essential moving forward as Canada is expected to see wildfire burn area double by 2050, as droughts and extreme heat caused by climate change intensify. Climate change is also likely to lead to more years like this one, where resources are stretched by wildfires ravaging numerous provinces simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Western Canada: This year’s fire season prompts dread over what’s to come\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, Canada is on track to exceed the largest total amount of burned area with 2,214 wildfires and 3.3 million hectares burned so far, according to data released June 4 by Natural Resources Canada. With fires stretching from Nova Scotia to Quebec, services have been pulled thin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the exact scenario we designed this mission to support,” said Josh Johnston, a research scientist at Great Lakes Forestry Centre and principal investigator of the WildFireStat mission. “There’s no way we can prevent this from happening. And when your resources are stretched, you need to be able to decide which fires are getting it, and which are not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Number of wildfires across country straining resources\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 400 wildfires still active in Canada\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfires are already monitored by satellites, but they are not dedicated to monitoring wildfires, and they are not over Canada in the afternoon and early evening, when – due to wind, heat and low humidity – wildfires are at “peak burn period.” This means the collected data are often insufficient. To fill in blanks, wildfires are currently monitored wi t h aircraft surveys – an expensive route that takes essential resources away from fighting fires burning closer to urban areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infrared sensors on the WildFireSat satellites, on the other hand, will combine data about wind direction, topography and dryness, and monitor all wildfires in Canada to determine which might turn into large uncontrolled burns – a category that only makes up 3 per cent of all wildfires, but lead to 97 per cent of burned area. This will enable firefighters to quickly dedicate resources toward suppression of more dangerous fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new satellites will also allow fire services to predict the direction of fires with more accuracy, thereby giving more notice to those who need to move, and avoiding unnecessary evacuations. So far this year, 26,000 Canadians have been evacuated from their homes; many only received a few hours of notice and, fleeing residential areas with no evacuation routes, were stuck in bottleneck traffic while the forest fire raged close by.\n",
      "\n",
      "The satellites will also be able to measure wildfire smoke, predicting when and how much will reach urban areas. This means governments will be able to issue warnings ahead of time, limiting exposure and lessening pressure on the health care system.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This advanced warning will lessen the impact on our economy,” Mr. Johnston said. “And the load on our health care system. This will make a big difference in public health and earlier evacuations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The satellites could also provide more data to wildfire researchers, said Mathieu Bourbonnais, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia. This is because satellites currently used to monitor wildfires often take photographs, so observation of the fires is limited by smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This data will give us a better understanding of how fires are behaving,” said Prof. Bourbonnais. “Being able to work with this data, understand fire spread and how climate change is impacting fires is super valuable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Much is left to do before the satellites can be launched in 2029, Mr. Johnston said. While the science on how to monitor wildfires from space is mature and similar projects have been proposed before, no other country has reached this point in the process, which makes the design novel but complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, normally infrared sensors need to be cooled using heavy equipment with high energy demands, increasing the weight and cost of operations. The WildFireSat sensors will use microbolometer technology that does not need to be cooled, reducing the weight and size of the satellite and the power required to operate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operational WildFireSat is currently engaging in preparatory contracts, with hopes to start building in the spring/summer of 2024. Should this timeline be met, it would be record-breaking speed for a project of this size, Mr. Johnston said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he emphasized the need for high quality control.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is probably the fastest we’ve ever delivered an operational satellite into orbit,” Mr. Johnston said. “But we need to be absolutely sure it’ll work. Our job is to design a system that can do this in real-time. There are no humans. It can never fail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Canada needs to focus on what can be done right now to limit wildfires, such as more investment in forest firefighting and building resilient communities with evacuation routes, Prof. Bourbonnais said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada also needs to think critically about land management, he added. For example, British Columbia is starting to do more prescribed fires and cultural burns, alongside fuel mitigation measures such as thinning and pruning forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Satellites give us the ability to monitor,” Prof. Bourbonnais said. “But ultimately, this comes down to climate change and land management decisions. And there’s a lot of mechanisms that we have available right now where we can start affecting change, well before 2029.”\n"

It’s a huge amount of land: five times larger than the sprawl of the Greater Toronto Area. And it’s way higher than the annual average of 2.9 million hectares burned in the 2010s, which was way higher than the 1.7 million hectares annually from 2000 to 2009. Escalation is obvious. The 1980s saw three years of two million-plus hectares burned; in the 1990s, three; in the 2000s, four; in the 2010s, seven; and twice so far in the 2020s.\n",
      "\n",
      "It all circles back to the interconnected extremes of human-caused climate heating. Rare levels of heat this spring create conditions for wildfires to thrive. Decades of fire suppression and logging made forests more susceptible to fire. Pests that flourish in a warmer climate eat up trees and make them further susceptible to flames. Hurricane Fiona last September toppled trees in Nova Scotia that burned this spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "How we got here is clear. A study of B.C.’s then-record 2017 fires drew a line between climate heating and the charred forests. A study last month connected fossil fuel and cement production with more than one-third of the forests torched in western North America over the past 35 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it will get hotter and hotter. This summer, temperatures across almost all of Canada are expected to be above normal. Temperatures here are rising at double the rate of the global increase. The rise from preindustrial times had been around 1.2 degrees Celsius. An increase of 1.5 C – which the Paris Agreement set as the hoped-for limit – will probably be eclipsed for the first time by 2027, according to new work from the World Meteorological Organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can be done starts foremost with cutting greenhouse-gas emissions as fast as possible. It means major investments in clean power to slash use of oil and natural gas across the economy. Every country must act. It may seem like domestic emissions are a small part of the world total, but consider that Canadian per-capita emissions are three-quarters greater than China’s and, historically, Canada has emitted close to as much as all of South America. The world has to get off its addiction to fossil fuels. As writer John Vaillant chronicles in his new book Fire Weather, combustion of fossil fuels has set the world ablaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "On wildfires themselves, they cannot be stopped, but there is much to do – from strict planning on what is built where and how it is built, to more use of methods such as prescribed burns. Canada already spends $1-billion a year on wildfires. The bill will rise. Conservatives continue to argue against the carbon tax and decry the cost of a litre of gasoline. There are other, bigger costs. Wildfires – like flooding – are a fearsome example, both in destruction (recovery tallied in the billions of dollars) and mitigation (investments tallied in the billions of dollars) – and, less easy to quantify, how they can wreck spring and summer days: windows closed, outdoor plans cancelled, air that’s dangerous to breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke of the country’s stretched resources, and said that governments must grapple with “how we can equip ourselves to deal with this new reality.” This space will have more later this week.\n"

      "Carly Weeks is a health reporter for The Globe and Mail. For this week’s deeper dive, she talks about the health impacts of air pollution caused by wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was walking my son to school last week when he asked why the air outside smelled like a campfire. I explained that it was the result of forest fires that were burning hundreds of kilometres away – a concept that I suspect he had trouble fully grasping, likely because it’s been difficult for most of us to wrap our heads around the enormity of the fires and our planet’s climate crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the air quality has improved dramatically in recent days, experts say we shouldn’t be lulled into believing that the worst is over. Already, this year is on track to be the worst year for wildfires in Canada on record. And that can have serious implications for our health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breathing in wildfire smoke is dangerous for a number of reasons. The air pollution caused by forest fires can be especially problematic for at-risk individuals, such as people with asthma, lung disease and other conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wildfire smoke poses health risks to everyone. That’s because it contains a mix of fine particles, which can include volatile organic compounds and ozone, that enter into our bloodstream when we breathe them into our lungs. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, there’s “no evidence of a safe level of exposure” for these pollutants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research into the impacts of this kind of air pollution is still evolving, but there are concerns that it can be linked to a higher risk of heart attack and stroke, for instance. It’s a sobering reality. Many of the researchers I spoke with were very frank about the fact that poor air quality events will become a bigger fact of life, even in areas far flung from wildfire hot spots. And they urge the public to consider how to protect themselves, whether that means keeping their kids home from outdoor recreational events during times of poor air quality, or wearing a mask if they have to be outside for an extended period when pollution levels are high.\n",

      "\n",
      "The driver of a tractor-trailer hauling gasoline lost control on an off-ramp and flipped the tanker truck on its side in a wreck that set it afire and destroyed a section of the East Coast’s main north-south highway, Pennsylvania’s top transportation official said Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first official accounting of a wreck that threw hundreds of thousands of morning commutes into chaos and disrupted untold numbers of businesses, state Transportation Secretary Mike Carroll said the driver was northbound “trying to navigate the curve, lost control of the vehicle, landed on its side and ruptured the tank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, Interstate 95 will be closed in both directions for weeks at the start of summer travel season. The elevated southbound portion of I-95 will have to be demolished, as well as the northbound side, Carroll said. Motorists should avoid the northeast corner of the sixth-largest city in the country, transportation officials said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pennsylvania State Police said a body recovered from the wreckage has been turned over to the Philadelphia medical examiner and coroner. Authorities are in the process of identifying the remains, police said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The accident also disrupted the automotive route from Canada to Florida through the Boston, New York and Washington metropolitan areas, increasing Americans’ dependence on air travel and on the interstate rail network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Videos shared on social media showed a number of close calls around the accident, with people driving through the area as flames licked upward from the fire below. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to investigate the accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carroll said the damaged I-95 segment carries about 160,000 vehicles daily. State police don’t know if the driver was speeding and no other vehicle has been found. Officials said they had been in contact with the trucking company, but they did not identify it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carroll said the highway span was 10 to 12 years old, had appeared sound and they blamed the damage on the heat of the fire, which took about an hour to control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster declaration Monday, saying it gives state agencies the ability to skip normal bidding-and-contracting requirements so the span can be repaired faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shapiro said his flight over the area showed “just remarkable devastation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I found myself thanking the Lord that no motorists who were on I-95 were injured or died,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "High heat from the fire or the impact of an explosion could have weakened the steel beams supporting the overpass, according to Drexel University structural engineering Professor Abi Aghayere. Bridges like the one that collapsed don’t typically have fire protection, like concrete casing, he added. It could have been coated in a fire-retarding paint, but even then the beams could have been weakened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It just gives you time,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among many transportation changes across the region, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority said it was operating three extra morning and late afternoon trains on its Trenton, New Jersey, line, and adding capacity to regularly scheduled lines during peak hours following the collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collapsed section of I-95 was part of a $212 million reconstruction project that wrapped up four years ago, state Transportation Department spokesman Brad Rudolph said. PennDOT rated the 104-foot span as in “good” condition earlier this year, with another inspection set for 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said the complete rebuild of I-95 would take “some number of months,” and in the meantime officials were looking at “interim solutions to reconnect I-95 and get traffic through the area.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph L. Schofer, a retired professor of civil and environmental engineering from Northwestern University, said a big challenge for PennDOT in quickly replacing the bridge could be getting heavy-duty steel beams of a hundred feet or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring the precise length necessary – either by finding the construction records or taking measurements – and finding a fabricator to make them could take time, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can’t go online to Amazon and order it and have it delivered the next day,” said Schofer, who also hosts a podcast on infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In California, a similar situation happened with a highway ramp in Oakland. It was replaced in 26 days, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now that’s almost a miracle,” Schofer said. In Atlanta, an elevated portion of Interstate 85 collapsed in a fire, shutting down the heavily travelled route through the heart of the city in March 2017. It took authorities there 43 days to replace it, Schofer said.\n",
      "\n",

      "Gail: We’re obviously in history-making territory — first former president indicted in a criminal case brought by the federal government. And this one, which involves trying to stash away official papers he’d been told were government property, is certainly a classic Trump combination of shocking and stupid.\n",

      "\n",
      "You?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bret: Three thoughts, Gail. The first is that Jack Smith, the special counsel, has produced irrefutable proof that Trump knew that he possessed, as the former president himself put it, “secret information” that he could have declassified when he was in office but didn’t. That may be about as close to a slam dunk, legally speaking, as we’re ever going to get in a case like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gail: True, but I want shockingly terrible besides terribly illegal. Go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bret: The second thought is that a special counsel appointed by President Biden’s attorney general is bringing a criminal case against the president’s presumptive opponent in next year’s election. To many Republicans, this will smack of a bald attempt to politicize justice and criminalize politics — the very thing Trump was accused of doing in his first impeachment. Trump will surely use this to his political advantage and, as the writer Damon Linker noted in a perceptive guest essay last week, will probably see his primary poll numbers jump yet again.\n"

      "['Hina Alam'] 2023-06-14 11:35:03-04:00 As wildfires from coast to coast scorch large swaths of forest, sometimes changing it irreversibly, experts have zeroed in on an often overlooked casualty of the blazes: wildlife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spring fires, such as the ones now burning across the country, are unusual and will possibly affect several species, said Karen Hodges, a biology professor at the University of British Columbia’s Okanagan campus.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the tree with a nest burns, those eggs or chicks obviously will not survive. The adults may be able to escape the fire, but the chances that they would reproduce again somewhere else is unlikely for this year. I think one immediate impact is that many individuals will fail to breed this year. Some will die,” she said in a recent interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Obviously, animals that can move away ahead of the fire will do so. But that depends how fast the fire is moving – whether the animals can outrun it. It’s really difficult to gauge that one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said Monday that more than 47,000 square kilometres have burned so far this year, with more than 430 wildfires raging across the country. Canada is experiencing its worst wildfire season of the 21st century, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hodges fears things will only get worse, with months of hotter temperatures ahead. “I do expect a lot of animals to be displaced or killed,” she said. “I do expect some populations in some regions to be gone, or small, for decades to come as a result of this year’s burns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Matthew Mitchell, research associate at the University of British Columbia’s land and food systems, said the carbon monoxide and particulate matter in wildfire smoke can have “acute” health effects on animals, some of which may not be seen for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It can affect their lungs, it can change blood chemistry, lower oxygen levels, and so then you can also have effects on the immune system,” he said in an interview. “Those sorts of things can lead to changes in the demography, or the survival, growth and reproduction of animals as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfire smoke could also lead to changes in behaviour, including how active animals are, whether they look for mates and how much they sing, he said. Orangutans and gibbons affected by wildfire smoke in more tropical areas were found to make less noise than those that weren’t exposed, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have observed fetuses of martens are negatively affected from wildfire smoke, Mitchell said. Early spring fires could impact pregnant animals or their newborns, just like they affect humans, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A study published in February in the journal Ecology Letters examined the regenerative power of forest fires and concluded the news is not all bad for wildlife species.\n",
      "\n",
      "It found that some ecosystems see a “species richness” after a fire, with birds and mammals seeing an increase in diversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How ecological and evolutionary drivers translate to effects on animal richness remains to be seen, but our findings show the cumulative effects to be strikingly positive, at least for bird and mammal richness,” the paper by Canadian, American and European researchers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Animals that have the ability to reproduce faster do better in a fire-prone environment, it noted. But it warned that fires in areas where they are not a regular occurrence are not particularly beneficial. “In these ecosystems, fire is more of a modern threat than an important process to maintain, and recent fire activity in these systems is not a likely driver of richness,” it said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While animals in Canada have adapted to wildfires that are a natural part of the ecosystem, Mitchell said repeatedly occurring “megafires” are changing the fire regime. There is less time between blazes, making it harder for the forest to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is not just birds and land creatures that are affected by wildfires. “Whales and dolphins, because of the way they breathe, are often coming up and exchanging almost all the air in their lungs as they breathe,” he said. “They actually might be more susceptible as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mitchell said he worries most for endangered species. “I would expect that we are going to lose some species, if these kind of smoke events, and these wildfires keep increasing,” he said. “Predicting which exact species those are, that’s going to be as difficult, but I would expect there’s going to be some loss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On the flip side, some species may benefit, but he said it is hard to predict which ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hodges said animals such as Canada lynx, marten, fisher and snowshoe hare need mature forests while others such as owls need big trees with cavities for nesting. But when fires burn these trees, it takes decades for them to grow back into mature forests. “These are going to be lasting changes.”\n"

      "\n",
      "The wildfires in Alberta, Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia are expected to contribute to higher home insurance prices across the country, as extreme weather events continue to hit insurers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Canadian insurance industry has seen the number of natural-disaster claims, due to events such as hurricanes, floods, hail storms and wildfires, more than quadruple since 2008. Last year, weather events accounted for $3.1-billion of insured losses – up from just $40-million in 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "DBRS Morningstar analyst Marcos Alvarez estimates the aggregate insured losses from the wildfires in Alberta and Eastern Canada will be “manageable” for most insurers, even as they “bear the weight of an above-average” wildfire season.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current fires are still “materially smaller” than the 2016 blaze in Fort McMurray, Alta., which spread across 590,000 hectares over two summer months. It destroyed more than 2,400 homes and caused $9.9-billion in damages – of which $3.6-billion was insured.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Mr. Alvarez said the increase in this year’s extreme weather and natural catastrophe losses – along with high inflation – will push home insurance prices higher everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Canadian property and casualty insurers have been exposed to larger and more frequent weather-related losses, which are driven not only by climate change but also by the rise of property values over time as well as changes in demographics and accumulation of insurable value in risk-prone zones,” he said in a research note.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire insurance is a standard feature of every home and business insurance policy and typically includes coverage for living expenses – food, clothing, hotel stays – when people cannot return home after a fire. Over the past three years, the Insurance Bureau of Canada has seen house insurance prices increase about 14 per cent – with a 5-per-cent spike in premiums in just the past 12 months, said Craig Stewart, vice-president of climate change and federal issues at IBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No single event will impact the price of insurance premiums, but insurers track the ongoing trends over time, including when wildfire events happen,” Mr. Stewart said in an interview. “And based on those longer-term models, we have seen premiums rising. As an insurer prices risk, we have seen in recent years that Canada is a riskier place to insure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Alvarez said construction costs have also been rising above inflation levels, putting upward pressure on the cost of materials and labour when rebuilding homes – one metric that insurers consider when setting premiums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor, Mr. Stewart said, is that reinsurers – global companies that take on some of the risk and provide financial protection to insurance companies – are raising their fees for insurance companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Global reinsurers have been adjusting their risk exposure around the world, and Canada has seen a significant increase in reinsurance rates over the past year,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spike in risk has caused several large property insurers in the U.S. – where insurers are limited to government-implemented price caps on premiums – to permanently halt sales of new policies in high-risk areas. Without being able to increase premiums, they are maxing out their risk appetite, Mr. Stewart said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of May, for example, State Farm General Insurance announced it would no longer accept applications in California for business and personal lines of property and casualty insurance due to “historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market.” Shortly after, Allstate Corp. announced similar reasons for no longer accepting new applications in the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of Canada’s largest property and casualty insurers, Intact Financial and Aviva Canada, say they continue to provide coverage in wildfire areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intact Financial spokesperson Katrina Caguimbal said all the company’s standard property policies offer full coverage for wildfires and the company does not restrict or limit the amount of coverage on those policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are not restricting wildfire coverage on existing policies in any areas in Canada due to wildfire exposures,” Ms. Caguimbal said in an e-mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "For renewals, both Intact and Aviva said they would not cancel a policy due to a policyholder’s proximity to a wildfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for individuals looking to set up new policies during a catastrophic event, Ms. Caguimbal said the company does put in place “binding restrictions for risks located within 25 kilometres of an out-of-control fire, or under imminent threat of a wildfire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“These restrictions mean that our teams will review and assess each exposure to ensure our underwriting decisions are sound and reasonable,” she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, some insurers have pushed that boundary further in certain areas – particularly in British Columbia – where temporary halts on new policies have been imposed for properties within 55 kilometres to 100 kilometres of a fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aviva spokesperson Bill Walker said Aviva “will not be taking action to change our risk appetite, underwriting stance or to remove or decrease coverage availability in areas at high risk of wildfire.” Although, he said, when there is a state of emergency, insurers – including Aviva – look at new risks “more closely, as part of due diligence.”\n"

      "\n",
      "A Russian air attack on Kyiv during an African peace mission to the city, including a barrage of cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, was a clear message that Moscow has no interest in negotiating peace, Ukrainian leaders say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia fired 12 missiles at Kyiv on Friday morning while the seven-country African delegation was in the city, Ukrainian officials said. All the missiles and a Russian drone were shot down by Ukrainian air defence, but at least four people were injured by falling debris on the outskirts of the city, the officials said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The African leaders, including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and six other presidents and government leaders, were on the first day of their peace mission to Ukraine and Russia. They were brought into a bomb shelter during the attack, according to a Reuters television crew that witnessed their movement.\n",

      "Russian missile attacks during foreign leader visits to Kyiv are relatively rare, although it has occasionally happened in the past.\n",

      "\n",
      "Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said the missile attack shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to attack any foreign leader who visits Kyiv. “Putin wants to demonstrate that he is willing to disregard the safety of foreign leaders and he actually doesn’t care because he feels complete impunity,” Mr. Yermak said in a message on Telegram.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two-day African peace mission to Ukraine and Russia was originally intended to include seven African presidents, but three cancelled and sent top officials instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the cancellations was Republic of Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who reportedly backed out because he considered the mission too dangerous. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni cancelled because he had tested positive for COVID-19, while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi cancelled for unknown reasons. The remaining presidents are from South Africa, Zambia, Senegal and Comoros.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ramaphosa’s official spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, said the African peace mission “marks the first time Africa has united behind finding a peaceful resolution to a conflict outside our continent.” Africa has been “severely impacted by the war in Ukraine,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food and fertilizer prices have soared in many African countries since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, and the peace mission is hoping to negotiate agreements to ease the barriers that restrict grain exports from Ukraine and fertilizer exports from Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ramaphosa said the peace mission’s main task was to listen to Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin to see if there were any potential grounds for compromise. But he may have annoyed his Ukrainian hosts by openly calling for a slowdown in the country’s counteroffensive against the Russian occupying forces, even after he had learned of the Russian missile attack on Kyiv.\n",
      "\n",
      "His spokesman, Mr. Magwenya, also raised eyebrows in Kyiv by casting doubt on the missile attack, referring to “the so-called explosion” and complaining of “deliberate misinformation.” But later in the day, Mr. Ramaphosa acknowledged that the missile attack was genuine and had been experienced by the African leaders themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The launching of the missiles today, in our view, does not deter us and has not stopped us from continuing to call for de-escalation,” Mr. Ramaphosa told a news conference with Mr. Zelensky and the African delegation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is precisely this type of event that we saw today – witnessed or even experienced – that makes us call for de-escalation. There are offensives on both sides and we are saying, those must be de-escalated as both countries proceed on the road to peace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He cited South Africa’s anti-apartheid hero, Nelson Mandela, as a role model for the two warring sides in Ukraine. “Even when he was in prison and apartheid was at its highest and worst, he said that was the time for us to enter into negotiations,” Mr. Ramaphosa said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zelensky, however, drew the opposite lesson from Mr. Mandela’s life, including his 27 years in prison. “History shows us that Nelson Mandela’s path was to fight, and if you keep fighting and righteousness is on your side, you can remain free, even behind bars or in the bunkers.”\n"

      "“Sunday, June 18, everything will be ready,” Mr. Lafrenière said. “The health centre will be ready, the grocery store will be ready, the dépanneur, the gas station, everything will be ready.”\n",

      "Forests Minister Maïté Blanchette Vézina said Friday that the flammability risk for the Lebel-sur-Quévillon area had risen overnight. However, officials said both the town and a nearby pulp mill – which had posed a concern because of chemicals stored there – are well protected by fire breaks and by the arrival of additional firefighters from the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town of about 2,000 people has been under an evacuation order since June 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lafrenière said an additional 140 firefighters from Portugal would be arriving to help attack fire 344, which remained out of control Friday morning. He said the fire, which has burned 1,320 square kilometres, has come within 3.5 kilometres of Highway 113, an important route in and out of the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he said the winds appeared favourable, which should allow the firefighters to make progress toward containing the section of the fire nearest to the highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lebel-sur-Quévillon, located 620 kilometres northwest of Montreal, is the last community that remains under a full evacuation order after unprecedented wildfires forced more than 13,500 people across the province from their homes over the past two weeks.\n",

      "\n",
      "A Russian air attack on Kyiv during an African peace mission to the city, including a barrage of cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, was a clear message that Moscow has no interest in negotiating peace, Ukrainian leaders say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia fired 12 missiles at Kyiv on Friday morning while the seven-country African delegation was in the city, Ukrainian officials said. All the missiles and a Russian drone were shot down by Ukrainian air defence, but at least four people were injured by falling debris on the outskirts of the city, the officials said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The African leaders, including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and six other presidents and government leaders, were on the first day of their peace mission to Ukraine and Russia. They were brought into a bomb shelter during the attack, according to a Reuters television crew that witnessed their movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian missile attacks during foreign leader visits to Kyiv are relatively rare, although it has occasionally happened in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the barrage on Friday was the largest missile attack on Kyiv in weeks. “Russian missiles are a message to Africa: Russia wants more war, not peace,” he said on Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said the missile attack shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to attack any foreign leader who visits Kyiv. “Putin wants to demonstrate that he is willing to disregard the safety of foreign leaders and he actually doesn’t care because he feels complete impunity,” Mr. Yermak said in a message on Telegram.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two-day African peace mission to Ukraine and Russia was originally intended to include seven African presidents, but three cancelled and sent top officials instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the cancellations was Republic of Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who reportedly backed out because he considered the mission too dangerous. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni cancelled because he had tested positive for COVID-19, while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi cancelled for unknown reasons. The remaining presidents are from South Africa, Zambia, Senegal and Comoros.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ramaphosa’s official spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, said the African peace mission “marks the first time Africa has united behind finding a peaceful resolution to a conflict outside our continent.” Africa has been “severely impacted by the war in Ukraine,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food and fertilizer prices have soared in many African countries since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, and the peace mission is hoping to negotiate agreements to ease the barriers that restrict grain exports from Ukraine and fertilizer exports from Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ramaphosa said the peace mission’s main task was to listen to Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin to see if there were any potential grounds for compromise. But he may have annoyed his Ukrainian hosts by openly calling for a slowdown in the country’s counteroffensive against the Russian occupying forces, even after he had learned of the Russian missile attack on Kyiv.\n",

Sparks from a heavy-duty mulcher had ignited a grassfire at a nearby farm, and the flames were spreading rapidly across the grazing land, threatening hundreds of sheep and dozens of towering wind turbines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maintenance worker shut off his torch and switched gears, stepping into his role as first lieutenant for the Country Fire Authority’s Pomonal Rural Fire Brigade.\n",
      "\n",
      "He checked an app on his phone to see which firefighters would be heading out to the fire and co-ordinated a location for the truck to pick him up en route. It was a Monday afternoon in February, late in the Australian summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Volunteer firefighter Steve Field suited up for duty after grass ignited at a farm in his area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Field, 52, is one of more than 140,000 volunteer firefighters who make up Australia’s unique system of bushfire response. While many countries use volunteer “firies,” none depend on them so much as the Land Down Under, where frequent hot and dry conditions, vast areas of forests and grasslands and highly flammable fuel types such as eucalyptus trees have made it one of the most fire-prone regions in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, about 90 per cent of firefighters are unpaid. It’s an arrangement that dates back to the mid-1800s, when farmers and those living in rural communities self-organized to create firefighting services where there were none.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, the majority of all firefighters are volunteers, but wildland fire management falls largely under the jurisdiction of provincial and territorial agencies that employ seasonal and full-time employees. However, with the country now experiencing its worst wildfire season of the 21st century, before even the start of summer, some agencies are actively exploring how they can bolster their wildfire response – and they could look to Australia’s community-based volunteers for lessons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Canadian government is already exploring the expansion of such initiatives, funding a five-year program, now in its pilot phase, to train community-based firefighters to respond to wildfires in remote and Indigenous communities. More than 300 Indigenous firefighters and 125 Indigenous fire guardians across Canada are expected to be hired and trained this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, in British Columbia – where three record wildfire seasons in five years stretched provincial firefighting resources beyond capacity – fire officials are rethinking their relationship with rural residents who defied evacuation orders and risked hefty fines to fight back flames with their own equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "They’ll need to navigate thorny issues, including liability, insurance and training – challenges that Australia has grappled with over the last decade. But some say it’s still worth exploring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By not [involving them], I would say we risk more of that underground activity, of seeing people do it on their own,” said Rob Schweitzer, executive director at the BC Wildfire Service. “By recognizing people and groups that have a skillset, an inventory and a bit of training, we can incorporate them – in a minor level, but in a safe manner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire smoulders in a forested area near farmers’ paddocks outside Rowsley, Victoria, this past February. Climate change is supercharging the Australian fire season, which, in southern regions like Victoria, can start as early as October and continue to May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rescue commander Damien Scott looks for a safe route through an active fire in Great Western. To reach rural fires, much depends on local knowledge of farm fences, drainage ditches and other obstacles. Prescribed burns help to clear out vegetation before it ignites on its own. Authorities want to avoid a repeat of the 2019-20 season when out-of-control fires burned an area about as big as Saskatchewan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the 1800s, Australia has relied on volunteer 'firies' to control a flammable landscape that Indigenous people long managed with their own systems of prescribed burns.\n",
      "\n",
      "A culture within a culture\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in Australia, Mr. Field and his crew were among 16 units with the Country Fire Authority, or CFA, to respond to the grassfire in the town of Great Western, about 225 kilometres northwest of Melbourne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clad in orange wildland apparel with yellow reflective stripes and a yellow helmet, Mr. Field doused the perimeter of the fire and worked his way inward, being careful to remain upwind.\n",
      "\n",
      "His white respirator was immediately darkened with soot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire was contained in about 90 minutes, leaving behind 60 hectares of smouldering farmland and two property owners grateful that no one was injured and nothing more damaged.\n",

      "In Australia, volunteer fire services, supported by a small number of paid staff, are responsible for providing firefighting services to rural and remote areas. In contrast, career firefighters typically work for agencies that respond to metropolitan areas. Each of the country’s six states and two territories has its own volunteer bushfire management service; New South Wales, home to nearly a third of all Australians, has the largest, with 72,855 operational and support volunteers across 1,993 brigades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each service has its own rules regarding minimum age, training, background checks and other requirements. Governments typically fund each fire management agency through local levies, and this money is used to purchase fire service sheds, tankers, hoses and other firefighting tools.\n",

      "In Victoria, the CFA requires that volunteer firefighters be 16 years or older, complete general training that can take up to six months and attend regular meetings and training sessions.

In emergencies, all agencies work together.\n",
      "\n",

      "At the CFA, volunteers include judges, university professors, farmers, IT specialists and maintenance workers like Mr. Field, all permitted under federal legislation to take unlimited unpaid leave from their jobs for volunteer emergency services work. “Most [firefighters] sign up so they can give something back to their community,” Mr. Slijepcevic said. “And, it’s a tradition. There’s the honour. Very frequently you’ll encounter a brigade with grandparents, parents and children at the same time.”\n",

      "In the state of Queensland, about 50 kilometres south of Brisbane, members of the Woodhill Rural Fire Brigade convened at their fire station in late February after conducting a pile burn for a private landowner. First Officer Ben Heilbronn picked up coffee and buns for the crew, whose members range in age from 16 to 64, to consume as they debriefed and chatted about weekend plans. He described the brigade, of which he’s been a member for 18 years, as a second family.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not just about going into battle and training hard, working hard and having a laugh,” Mr. Heilbronn said. “It’s a real sense of extended family for so many people, and that’s a culture within a culture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Across from him sat firefighter Treen Bangay, a car collector and drag racer with chunky gold rings, a sharp tongue and sleeve tattoo of a female firefighter. Next to her, third officer Colin Howell, a pensioner with a decades-old collection of firefighting memorabilia who quipped that he would be sitting at home twiddling his thumbs if not for the brigade. Leslie Meade, a former soldier who now works in IT, joined three years ago looking to get out of the house and socialize, finding himself drawn to the immediate and tangible rewards of the work. Dean Brunker, nicknamed “Senior” so as not to be confused with his firefighter son, signed up after leaving the military, missing the camaraderie.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once you’re with a group like this, you’re spending hours in trucks, at fires,” said Mr. Howell, who has been with the brigade for 26 years. “You get to know one another’s families, all of their issues. You can be the sounding board where the husband or wife is at home, you can talk about family, you can be a shoulder to cry on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For others, firefighting is a continuation of a tradition that existed long before the formalities of structured brigades and legislation. In the rural and remote areas of western Queensland, farmers, ranchers and others employed in similar roles make up primary producer brigades, a special classification of volunteer firefighters that are more self-sufficient than typical brigades, subject to fewer training requirements and have minimal contact with Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, or QFES, the state’s government agency responsible for firefighting. They are not unlike the ranchers and loggers of B.C., equipped with their own machinery and knowledge of the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "QFES Deputy Commissioner Michael Wassing called these brigades a “powerful local source,” that follow a community self-help model more than any other fire service. Registering with the rural fire service offers these brigade members workers’ compensation insurance and any personal protective clothing or firefighting equipment that they may need, but they typically use their own graders, dozers and vehicles and are left to their own devices, Deputy Commissioner Wassing said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They don’t ask for much, and the value they provide is enormous,” he said. “So when they do want a bit of help, it’s really important that we’re there to help them, but also not to overregulate them, too.”\n",

      "Volunteers make up about 70 per cent of all Canadian firefighters, and nearly all outside of city centres. At wildland-urban interface fires – where forests and vegetation meet communities and other human-made structures – career municipal and volunteer firefighters are typically responsible for assessing which properties are defendable, installing sprinklers and doing structural firefighting.\n",

      "Very rarely are these firefighters on the frontlines of wildfires, but it does happen, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Municipal firefighters have training on urban-interface firefighting, meaning that we don’t need to call in our colleagues in wildfire, necessarily, to extinguish a fire in tree-type areas,” he said. “In Canada, what’s happening right now, because resources are spread so thin of our wildland colleagues, there is a heavier reliance on our municipal firefighters actively involved in both the wildland – the edge between structure and trees – and on the forested side as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In challenging wildfire seasons when provinces need assistance, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre co-ordinates resource-sharing and mutual aid, both nationally and internationally. This season has already seen some wildland firefighters sent across provinces and others arrive from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Costa Rica.\n",
      "\n",
      "In British Columbia, the BC Wildfire Service manages wildfires on both Crown and private lands, employing a network of seasonal firefighters, permanent staff and contractors. On wildland-urban interface fires, the provincial wildfire service might request assistance from a local fire department for structural protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a system that was sufficient for more than a century, until it wasn’t; in 2017, more than 12,100 square kilometres of the province burned, shattering records, displacing 65,000 people and and overwhelming provincial resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Up until about 2017, our agency had the ability to essentially suppress almost any wildfire that we wanted to, through aerial [and] ground resources, heavy equipment,” said Mr. Schweitzer, the BC Wildfire Service executive director. “But the conditions of the forests now, in conjunction with climate change and the increased lightning storms we’re seeing, we’re not able to control every fire. It overrides any level of resourcing that you could possibly have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wildfire seasons are only expected to worsen. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted that human-caused climate change is increasing the amount of land burned by wildfire. It cited a study that found B.C.’s 2017 fires burned an area of land between seven and 11 times greater than compared with a scenario without such influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "”As the climate continues to warm, we can expect that extreme wildfire seasons like 2017 in B.C. will become more likely in the future,” wrote the authors of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "In North Vancouver, members of the Richmond fire department train with the B.C. Wildfire Service for a scenario where fire crosses the wildland-urban interface. The joint exercises this past May brought together firefighters with municipal experts in protecting structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "BCWS and Indigenous firefighters carry out a prescribed burn in the ʔaq’am community outside Cranbrook, B.C. This is part of the Ktunaxa Nation, which is trying to bring traditional First Nations fire management back into practice. Ashley O’Neill, a Ktunaxa firefighter, is one of those taking part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenny Forbes of the BCWS, left, talks tactics with his team during the ʔaq’am operation. First Nations like this one, and wildland-urban interfaces like North Vancouver, are important fronts in the battle against increasingly devastating fire seasons in the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer of 2018, record-setting heat and severe lightning storms challenged the BC Wildfire Service like never before. In less than two weeks in August, the service responded to more than 400 new fire starts; it would become the province’s most destructive wildfire season, scorching 13,500 square kilometres of land and breaking the record set just one year prior.\n",
      "\n",
      "In B.C.’s Central Interior, multiple fires threatened Francois Lake, a community just south of Burns Lake, known for its ranching, farming and forestry, and home to the Cheslatta Carrier Nation. With official firefighting resources taxed and livelihoods at stake, roughly 100 residents defied evacuation orders in efforts to protect their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under B.C.’s Wildfire Act, a person defying an evacuation order during a wildfire can face a fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both; the penalties grow when a state of emergency is declared and the Emergency Program Act enabled. People who do leave are not permitted to return until the order is lifted, and children are never allowed to remain in an evacuation zone even if their guardians choose to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the holdouts in Francois Lake were David and Risé Johansen, owners of the Takysie Lake Resort, a community hub that also includes a grocery store, restaurant and gas station. As Mr. Johansen used their pumper truck – usually used to empty septic tanks – to extinguish lightning-caused fires, his wife saturated the property with sprinklers and garden hoses. Other residents used their own heavy equipment to construct fire guards.\n",
      "\n",
      "On good days, there were no signs of fire. On bad days, the sky was coloured in grey and orange, and a sleepless Ms. Johansen would stay up to video record the store inventory for insurance purposes, wondering if they would have to hop on a boat to escape the flames advancing from over the hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the evacuation order, the regional district restricted ferry access, the main access point to the community, angering residents who were prevented from stocking up on supplies. Ms. Johansen recalled with frustration tense interactions with police enforcing the evacuation order, including one incident in which an RCMP officer jumped on the hood of their car as they tried to drive past a checkpoint, and another in which officers asked for her dental records so that they could later identify her remains. BC Wildfire Service crews were skilled and heroic, she said, but were too few and too late.\n",

      "In the end, the Johansens lost one cabin and part of the fence line, but the resort remained. Two neighbours’ homes burned down. The Cheslatta Carrier Nation lost three-quarters of its community forest.\n",

      "“I can promise you that if every Southside resident had left when they told us to, there wouldn’t be a Southside left to come back to,” Ms. Johansen said.\n",

      "In the aftermath of 2018, Ms. Johansen founded the Chinook Emergency Response Society (CERS), a group dedicated to preparing and mobilizing the community for future disasters. Rio Tinto, formerly Alcan, provided eight cargo trailers and one industrial trailer – with water tanks, pumps, hoses and other necessary equipment – as part of an ongoing reconciliation process with the Cheslatta, who were forcibly relocated in the 1950s to make way for an industrial project. The society has since organized formal wildfire training, hosted wildfire preparedness days and created a call list of volunteers who are prepared to respond.\n",

      "Fighting for more volunteer firefighters\n",
      "\n",
      "As Canadian provinces consider whether, or how, to involve more community groups in wildfire response, it’s worth noting the challenges of the Australian model. After Australia’s catastrophic bushfire season of 2019-2020, which burned an area roughly the size of Saskatchewan, a royal commission report noted that climate change has made bushfire seasons longer, more extreme and less predictable, resulting in greater expectations and demands being placed on volunteers. International media reports on the disaster, which came to be known as Black Summer, both lauded the heroism of the country’s volunteer firefighters and questioned whether they are enough. Of 82,480 emergency services personnel to respond, 64,500, or 78 per cent, were volunteers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A survey of more than 4,000 personnel who responded that summer found that 4.6 per cent of volunteers experienced “very high psychological distress indicative of serious mental illness,” including probable post-traumatic stress disorder. About the same amount experienced suicidal ideation – double that of the general population. Of volunteers with high need for mental health support, 58 per cent had not received any in the 12 months following the fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "A resulting report noted that while all emergency services have policies and procedures in place to support the mental health of personnel, many are at or above capacity in ordinary times and that it will be important to consider how to scale up following major disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Falling volunteer numbers raise further questions. Figures from the Australian government’s Productivity Commission show that the number of volunteer firefighters has fallen to 140,151 in 2021-22 from 173,017 nine years earlier – a 19 per cent decrease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire service leaders offer a number of reasons as to why this may be. An aging population, coupled with younger people gravitating toward urban centres, is one. The Productivity Commission’s figures show that the number of paid, career firefighters grew 27 per cent to 15,157 over the same period, adding weight to the theory that urbanization is at least partly to blame. Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic also had a significant impact on work force numbers, including on volunteerism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, volunteer firefighter numbers have similarly fallen, from 126,000 in 2016 to 90,000 in 2022 – about a 29 per cent decrease, according to an estimate by the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a considerable part of Australia’s drop in volunteer firefighter numbers can be attributed to a growing emphasis on occupational health and safety, spelled out in ambitious targets in national guidelines, that has led to stricter training and accreditation standards. Some volunteers have pushed back against what they see as needless government bureaucracy, arguing that they are not public servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "CFA Chief Officer Jason Heffernan said much of this tension can be traced to 2012, when Australia introduced work health and safety legislation intended to both improve workplace safety rules and harmonize them across the country. The laws dictated that employers were required to ensure the safety of workers through new protections such as specific training requirements and personal protective equipment standards, or face large fines or imprisonment. Notably, the legislation defined “workers” to include volunteers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Up until then, all volunteer organizations, including volunteer fire services, had a legal obligation to provide a safe work environment, and that was the extent of it,” Mr. Heffernan said. “We never had to make sure we had robust risk assessments, training programs, PPC, checks and balances. … What it meant was that we can’t just have any Tom, Dick and Harry [fighting fires].”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heilbronn, the first officer at the Woodhill Rural Fire Brigade, said this has led to cultural clashes, particularly among those with generations of firefighting experience who are now saddled with paperwork and must undergo training that he likened to first-year university courses. He said he understood the frustration of firefighters but also the need for adequate safety protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People, at this level, don’t see why they need it,” he said. “But at a higher level, they need it to reduce WorkCover premiums, to fix workplace health and safety issues. This is a hazardous, risky job, so you have to legislate or put a whole heap of procedures around it to cover government, to say, ‘We did everything we could to protect them.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Fire services such as the CFA are changing their recruitment practices to make up for the decline in volunteers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deputy Commissioner Wassing said there continue to be consultations about how best to modernize the service, with particular caution to groups such as the fiercely independent primary producer brigades.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Potentially, you just push a work force underground, and we don’t want to do that,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaylene Jones, deputy chief officer for operational performance and capability at the CFA, said the organization has adapted its recruitment strategy to target busy, younger would-be volunteers. This has included moving some training components online; targeted recruiting for specific roles, such as a truck driver; and offering nationally-recognized training that can be applied to full-time jobs, such as chainsaw and heavy machinery certifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s about trying to enhance their lives, based on the fact that they’re giving up something for the service,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked whether a volunteer model is sustainable in the face of longer and more demanding wildfire seasons, the CFA’s Mr. Heffernan said it is precisely the surge capacity afforded by the model that makes it work. Whereas the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre co-ordinates national and international resource deployment, each volunteer fire service in Australia can draw from a local pool of firefighters many times bigger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reality is that there is no government that can afford the alternative,” he said. “Let’s say the 2019-2020 season, we’re talking hundreds of thousands of volunteer firefighters right across the country. We’re talking trillions of dollars needed to pay those firefighters for that one event.”\n",
      "\n",
      "CFA chief executive Natalie MacDonald agreed, noting that the agency was able to move thousands of volunteers around the state overnight during the Black Summer fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our environment needs it,” she said. “It is the only model that is sustainable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After the inferno outside Rowsley in Victoria, volunteers put out spot fires. Outfits such as these operate under health-and-safety guidelines that have grown increasingly strict over the past decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ian Price, 83, watches a planned burn from the back of a truck near Ararat. Like many in the volunteer brigades, he says he has been a member all his life. As wildfire seasons grow longer, volunteers are the only sustainable way to fight back, says CFA Chief Officer Jason Heffernan: ‘The reality is that there is no government that can afford the alternative.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Working together\n",
      "\n",
      "In British Columbia, the province’s recent extreme wildfire seasons forced the BC Wildfire Service to take a hard look at its sometimes frosty relationship with community groups, said Mr. Schweitzer, the executive director. Whereas once they were scolded for their defiance, they’re now being eyed for their local knowledge and desire to be part of the solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are people that have lived on these parcels of land for generations – a rancher, a logging family, people in rural settings – that have said, ‘You know what? I know as much as you do about this land, about the weather, about the topography, about the terrain and water sources.’ And up until 2017, we weren’t doing a good job engaging with them,” he said. “Frankly, it was, ‘Get out of our way. We know what we’re doing.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cooperative Community Wildfire Response project, now in its early days, will comprise two streams, Mr. Schweitzer said. The first will focus on rural Indigenous communities that may have less capacity to lead a response; on this, the wildfire service has partnered with Indigenous Services Canada, the First Nations’ Emergency Services Society and a researcher from the University of B.C. to conduct surveys on local and traditional knowledge, training and equipment. The first crew created under this partnership is the Simpcw Indigenous Initial Attack Crew, which managed numerous lightning-caused fires on their territory just north of Kamloops last summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second stream will focus on ranchers, loggers and other rural community members who have already self-organized, or are willing to. The wildfire service has already met with the BC Cattlemen’s Association, as the ranching sector is expected to play a big role. In 2021, the groups trialled a joint “rancher liaison” program, with the goal of improving the flow of information between BCWS and ranchers in wildfire zones. Since then, they have created educational materials on wildfire operations, cultural sensitivities and heavy equipment safety. Last summer, 44 liaisons were trained and on standby, and seven were deployed to support BCWS and incident management teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "BC Cattlemen’s Association General Manager Kevin Boon said ranchers are well-positioned to get involved, as most have their own excavators, bulldozers and water trucks, and have generational knowledge of the land. He said the association is hoping to partner with the BCWS on formal wildfire suppression training for interested groups in the next couple of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Thank-you signs in Sicamous, B.C., in 2021, when locals in T-shirts used hoses to fight spot fires in the White Rock Lake blaze. Groups in the B.C. backcountry say they could play a more organized firefighting role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Schweitzer said while informal conversations are underway, the service is hoping to formally identify these groups – which he expects to be few, but important – by the end of the year, after which they still must work through the same issues of training, liability, coverage and risk as the Australian volunteer fire services have navigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, only groups that are formally contracted with the BC Wildfire Service, such as the Simpcw crew, are covered. Mr. Schweitzer said the service is now mulling the creation of a society model, such as a small group of ranchers and loggers who receive training through the service, and the feasibility of extending protections to those societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be honest, that’s what’s gotten in the way for years,” he said. “But, for years, we were able to go about it on our own as an agency and do what we needed to do to suppress the fire. Now, we’re trying to figure out this hybrid model.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Under B.C.’s Wildfire Act, government may provide compensation to those who help fight wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another group that the wildfire service has already been in contact with is the Chinook Emergency Response Society.\n",
      "\n",
      "They “were highly critical of our organization,” Mr. Schweitzer said, referencing the 2018 response. “We now have an equipment cache on that side and a bit of an informal protocol to say, if something starts over there and you’re able to put some heavy machinery on it, or get some water on that lightning strike, just give us a call.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so they have. When machinery sparked a fire in a log pile at a ranch south of Francois Lake, Ms. Johansen immediately posted about it on the society’s Facebook page and began calling neighbours, initiating a “phone tree” to inform residents and co-ordinate resources. Within half an hour, dozens of residents and two trailers were on site, and the fire extinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Johansen recalled speaking with a BCWS officer and long-time Burns Lake resident who was impressed by the response. In future incidents like this, she recalled him saying, they can call BCWS and direct them to stand down so they can redirect resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He really had respect for how quickly it happened, how many people responded, the cohesiveness of how they worked together, and he saw the effectiveness of it,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was no, ‘Oh my god, why did you do this?’ It was, you know, ‘Good job.’ So now, to be able to say to them, ‘We’ve got it. You can stand down,’ I don’t know if you can imagine what kind of a feeling that is for us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Open this photo in gallery: Smoke from the White Rock Lake wildfire rises over Okanagan Lake near Vernon, B.C., in 2021. With a new fire season under way, the debate continues among BCWS and communities about how to best respond to disasters like these.\n",

      "This year’s wildfire season is already the most severe one this century, with 449 fires burning across Canada as of June 12, and roughly half of them deemed out of control. More than five million hectares have been scorched to date – almost 15 times the annual average amount of the last decade – and it’s only mid-June.\n",
      "\n",
      "By all measures, from number of fires (including the number of out-of-control fires) and provinces affected to the area burned and the number of evacuees, records haven’t just been broken – they have been obliterated. And Canada’s system of sharing wildfire-fighting resources is being put to the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many have commented how this is just a preview of what’s to come more often, as the effects from climate change continue to grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, it is the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) (pronounced SIFF-CEE) that works to co-ordinate the sharing and movement of provincial and territorial wildfire suppression resources to where they are needed most.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also arranges for the use of out-of-country resources, both in terms of equipment and people. And while it most often looks south of the border for help, from time to time it needs to bring in boots on the ground from other places. This year, along with at least 600 “hot shots” and “smoke jumpers” and hardware from the U.S., CIFFC has brought in assistance from South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, France, Spain and, soon, Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the system works well – although this year, it is strained.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent days, there has been a suggestion from several observers that Canada could use a fleet of federally owned air tankers (water bombers), which drop water or fire retardant from above. This fleet could be used as a reserve force for when things really hit the fan, and it’s an idea worth considering, particularly as Canada’s existing provincial fleet continues to age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada’s 38 national parks and 10 national park reserves – most of them forested – cover almost 350,000 square kilometres. Yet, Parks Canada – the federal agency that is responsible for managing that land, including fires, does not own its own fleet of air attack hardware. Instead, allowing for the remote location of much of the land and considering the important role that fire plays in ecosystem health, many fires are left to run their course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parks Canada does have access to aerial attack hardware (namely helicopters), but this is through contracts with private companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggestion is that the federal government purchase its own air tankers (more specifically, water-scooping skimmers that scoop water and retardant aircraft, which are loaded on the ground) and house these within Parks Canada. These could be used in federal parks in lieu of contracts with private suppliers, but also be made available to the provinces and territories in times of crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggestion is also that these aircraft, or at least some of them, be made available year-round to provide support to other countries, just as we are benefiting from international help during this present crisis. Currently, the provinces and territories tend to stow their fleets and have no access to crews in our off-season, when out-of-country demand is highest.\n",
      "\n",
      "This system works quite well in Australia, where the National Aerial Firefighting Centre – the Aussie equivalent of CIFFC – has co-ordinated the procurement of a fleet of firefighting aircraft that are readily available to complement those owned and operated by state and territorial fire agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The national fleet was funded by Australia’s federal, state and territorial governments, and the daily costs of operating the federal aircraft are paid for by whichever state or territory is using them at the time. The arrangement has been calculated to deliver $6.4-million in net benefits every year through procurement staff and service-provider cost savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the inner workings of the Australian system can be implemented here, though the Aussies have chosen to house their fleet within a CIFFC-like organization. That is an option here, but industry advocates believe such hardware would best sit with Parks Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a year with fires raging across the country, the rare loss of a large number of homes in the east, and smoke blanketing Canadian and American urban centres while affecting millions of people (most of whom do not live anywhere near a forested area), we are being not-so-gently reminded that the future is now. Federal, provincial and territorial officials need to have urgent conversations about strengthening our firefighting capacities, and beefing up the strength of our air tanker fleets will be key.\n"

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni cancelled because he had tested positive for COVID-19, while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi cancelled for unknown reasons. The remaining presidents are from South Africa, Zambia, Senegal and Comoros.\n",

Based on what we now know, what Fadden said was mild. He focused mainly on attempts by China to interfere through gestures of so-called friendship, rather than threats. But back then, few wanted to listen. Not the majority of MPs or in the media, who condemned Fadden for everything from raising the issue without clearing it with the government, to fomenting hatred against Canadians of Chinese origin.\n",

Fadden initially commented publicly about foreign interference in response to a question after a speech he gave in March 2010 at Toronto’s Royal Canadian Military Institute to police, military and intelligence and security officials. “There are several municipal politicians in British Columbia and in at least two provinces there are ministers of the Crown whom we think are under at least the general influence of a foreign government,” Fadden said. “They have no idea.

      "\n",
      "Canada’s unusually early and severe wildfire season is causing delays and complicating the closing of real estate deals, even for homes unaffected by flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfires can trigger moratoria on new home-insurance policies and put downward pressure on appraised values, two factors that can hamper homebuyers’ efforts to secure financing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while those effects are temporary – and far less serious than those facing people directly affected by a fire – they can result in added costs for both buyers and sellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Halifax, real estate agent Jacqui Rostek Holder said she was shocked to learn that insurers had implemented freezes on new home-insurance policies within radiuses of between 25 kilometres and 50 kilometres from the massive fire that encroached on the city’s northwest in late May and early June.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halifax is a pretty dense city overall: 50 kilometres from the evacuation area encompasses most of it, even areas that are much further away,” said Ms. Rostek Holder, who is an associate broker at Royal LePage Atlantic’s Platinum Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "But pausing the issuance of new policies for properties in the vicinity of a catastrophic event is standard practice for insurers, according to Craig Stewart, vice-president of climate change and federal issues at the Insurance Bureau of Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Typically the rationale is, an insurer does not want to be taking on new risk in an area that’s under imminent threat,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The threat could come from an uncontrolled fire, flooding, tornadoes or other natural disasters, Mr. Stewart added.\n",
      "\n",
      "While none of Ms. Rostek Holder’s clients ran into this issue, she said she heard of a few cases of homebuyers who were temporarily unable to obtain policies for their new homes, which, in turn, caused their lenders to hold off on financing the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those delays then pushed back other home deals, as some homeowners waited for the sale of their home to close before finalizing their own property purchase, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most lenders require buyers to show proof they have bought home insurance before lending money for a mortgage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Rostek Holder said her clients with deals about to close had already obtained an insurance binder, a document that confirms the insurer’s commitment to a policy. The issue, she said, was for other buyers who hadn’t already done so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leanne Myles, a Dartmouth, N.S.-based associate mortgage broker with the Clinton Wilkins Mortgage Team, said she has one client with a deal closing in July who hasn’t yet been able to procure an insurance binder for their new property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insurers lift any restrictions on new policies once they’ve determined that the threat has subsided, though when exactly that may be can vary by company, Mr. Stewart said.\n",
      "\n",
      "One risk is that the delay will push back the closing date, which can require the redrafting of documents and result in added lawyer fees, Ms. Myles said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a particular at this time of rising interest rates is that the delay will cause a buyer’s mortgage rate hold to expire, potentially saddling them with higher borrowing costs, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rate hold is a guarantee that locks in a specific fixed-term mortgage rate for a certain period of time, usually up to 120 days. If a borrower finalizes the mortgage within that time frame, they’re entitled to that rate even if fixed rates on new mortgages rise in the meantime.\n",
      "\n",
      "With financial markets putting upward pressure on fixed interest rates for new mortgages and renewing mortgages in response to fresh concerns about stubbornly high inflation, losing a rate hold can be costly for buyers. While Ms. Myles said none of her clients ran into this issue, she added it is a risk for borrowers experiencing delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As mortgage brokers, we would fight for that not to happen,” she said. “But we would likely have to fight for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Home appraisals are another potential headache for buyers and sellers, Ms. Myles said. That’s one of the top concerns for one of her clients, who is in the process of both selling their home and buying a new property within an area that was evacuated because of the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "While neither home has suffered damages, the worry is that property values in those areas might now be lower, Ms. Myles said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consequences of a lower-than-expected appraisal can be especially serious for homebuyers. If the appraised value is below the agreed purchase price, the lender will fund a smaller mortgage. If the deal falls through because the buyer can’t bridge the difference between the mortgage and purchase price, they could lose their deposit and face penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "But buyers can protect themselves by making their purchase conditional on obtaining home insurance as well as financing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stewart, in particular, recommends tying the insurance condition to the closing date, rather than a particular interim period. That way, the safeguard holds even if the closing is postponed, he said.\n"

We owe them our lives and long-standing indebtedness, but shockingly, firefighters’ average life span is 10 years less than the average Canadian’s. As well as toxic chemicals in smoke from forests and buildings, firefighters absorb chemicals from their gear. Substances to repel water, and to retard ignition and burning, have been associated for decades with increased risk of cancer, IQ deficits, hyperactivity, hormone disruption, reduced fertility and more. Today’s fires are the face of accelerating climate chaos. Canada must multiply efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, halt monoculture forestry and foster firebreaks such as aspen and birch, and find safer options for firefighters’ gear and practices, to prevent both fires, and firefighters’ toxic exposures.\n",

The scientific facts are undeniable: Harvesting old forests, and subsequent reforestation through seeding, planting or natural regrowth is a wonderful way to devour the overabundance of carbon in the air. As a forest grows to maturity, it continues to gobble up carbon. But once it is mature and goes into a resting stage, the carbon take-up diminishes quickly. So, if we want to store carbon, and keep it stored for hundreds of years, we should, as a general rule, harvest mature forests.\n",

      "As my 150-year-old desk, and my great-great-grandparents’ 400-year old barn and house in Sweden illustrate, using wood wisely is an excellent way to store carbon for many generations. We in North America must start looking more closely at the science of forests and forest products, and use this renewable resource to full advantage in reducing the carbon emissions destroying our world.\n",

Surely as a society we have moved beyond retributive justice. Kristen and Leslie lost their lives in a horribly unjust manner but vindictive punishment is not going to bring them back.

      "\n",
      "Residents in the capital, Khartoum, and its neighbouring city of Omdurman reported “relative calm” in the first hours of the ceasefire Sunday morning, after fierce clashes were reported the previous day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudan descended into chaos after fighting erupted in mid-April between the military, led by General Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, commanded by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.\n",

      "The three-day truce that began Sunday came ahead of a pledging conference the UN and other nations will hold Monday to raise funds to cover Sudan’s humanitarian needs.\n",

      "The UN says it received less than 16 per cent of the US$2.57-billion required to help those in need in Sudan in 2023. Another US$470-million is needed to support refugees in the Horn of Africa region, it said.\n",

      "The U.S. and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement that the military and RSF agreed to halt fighting and “refrain from seeking military advantage during the ceasefire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fighting capped months of worsening tensions between the rival generals. The conflict turned Khartoum and other urban areas into battlegrounds. More than 3,000 people lost their lives and over 6,000 others were wounded, according to Health Minister Haitham Mohammed Ibrahim. It forced more than 2.2 million people to flee their homes to safer areas inside Sudan and to neighbouring nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of Sudan’s neighbours have their own conflicts and economic problems and the influx of Sudanese refugees adds to the burden. Cash-strapped Egypt has received more than 200,000 Sudanese since the fighting began in mid-April, according to the UN migration agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, announced Sunday the allocation of €20-million (about $28-million) to help the Egyptian government deal with the influx of Sudanese who fled the war and crossed into Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know this is not enough and you are going to pay much more, but at least, let us contribute a little bit in your support,” Mr. Borrell told a joint news conference in Cairo with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ceasefire was the latest in a series of attempted truces brokered by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, all of which failed to stop the fighting, with the meditators blaming the two warring sides for repeated violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The humanitarian situation in the war-ridden country has been worsening. At least 24.7 million people – more than half of the country’s population – need humanitarian assistance. And over 100,000 children are projected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition with medical complications by the end of the year, the World Health Organization warned on Friday.\n",

Winds were forecast to gust from 30 mph to 40 mph (48-64 kph) on Sunday east of Flagstaff, Arizona along the Interstate 40 corridor and up to 50 mph (80 kph) on Monday, creating potentially critical fire weather across much of northeast New Mexico. A large brush fire that broke out Friday afternoon south of Tucson, Arizona shut down a state highway on Saturday. Arizona 83 reopened on Sunday and no homes were in immediate danger, authorities said.\n",

John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency for north and central parts of his state after strong winds and severe weather caused widespread power outages on Saturday. On Sunday, more than 450,000 people were without electricity in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, according to PowerOutage.us. Catherine Haley was hosting her six grandchildren, ages 7 to 13, in Shreveport, Louisiana when the storm knocked out electricity to her block and many surrounding neighbourhoods. Haley, who has trouble breathing, said they draped damp towels around their necks to try and stay cool, but when the heat became unbearable the family took refuge at a cooling centre set up by the city.\n",

And then I have COPD, and the heat really took effect on me as well,” Haley, 64, said Sunday. She said five of the grandchildren had just arrived from Houston for the summer when the storm hit, causing widespread damage. “Nice little welcome for them,” she joked. In Florida, the weather service issued another heat advisory Sunday, this time mainly for the Florida Keys. Forecasters said heat index readings – the combination of high temperatures and oppressive humidity – could reach between 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 Celsius) and 112 degrees (45 C) in places such as Key Largo, Marathon and Key West. “These conditions will cause increased risk of heat illness for people outdoors or in non-air conditioned spaces,” the weather service said in a bulletin.\n",

Based on what we now know, what Fadden said was mild. He focused mainly on attempts by China to interfere through gestures of so-called friendship, rather than threats. But back then, few wanted to listen.

      "['Marsha Lederman'] 2023-06-20 11:51:51-04:00 Two weeks ago, the single highway connecting several west coast communities on Vancouver Island was shut down because of a wildfire. The fire, east of Port Alberni, was so far away that the skies above Tofino and Ucluelet were clear; not at all smoky. But suddenly, the towns were cut off – Port Alberni too, as well as some First Nations communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highway 4 is expected to reopen this weekend, with single-lane alternating traffic through the area of the wildfire, which is now under control.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is only one instance. In an already unprecedented fire season, what else might we face this year across Canada – and, as the climate emergency continues, in years to come?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are still ways over to Tofino – by plane, if you can afford it, and by a gravel-road alternate route, if you can handle it. But authorities have recommended that ground route for essential travel only.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highway closure comes at a terrible time. June is a critical month, launching the busy tourist season. Businesses were gearing up with new hires and stocked supplies. And this June comes after a soft fall and winter – not to mention all the losses and uncertainty of COVID before that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Property taxes are due in early July, and some people were relying on June revenues to pay them. This time, there’s no federal COVID funding to bridge the gap, but rather, looming COVID loans to repay. Then there’s inflation. Everything costs more right now, just as so much less is coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of the road is an issue not just for tourism, but for locals who need supplies, have medical appointments or must travel for other reasons. There was also the problem of getting the tourists who were already there out, especially if they’re driving rental cars with contracts stipulating no driving on gravel roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tony Wickaninnish Inn went from about 75 per cent occupancy to 40 per cent during that first week of the shutdown. After June 13, when officials announced the highway wouldn’t open until at least June 24, it was down to 20 to 30 per cent capacity. “We are not in a profitable situation,” managing director Charles McDiarmid told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some businesses have had to lay off staff. Some workers have left town for jobs elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been watching money just bleed away,” says Heather Riddick with the Black Rock Oceanfront Resort in Ucluelet, which she estimates has lost about 40 per cent of its revenue for this month. “Businesses are now on their knees.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even once the highway re-opens, so much damage has been done. Some people have cancelled reservations into August, including international travellers. Over in Europe, they’re hearing about their vacation spot being cut off by a wildfire the same time they’re reading headlines about wildfires from Canada choking cities in the U.S. Far away, a connection is made, and a decision: Let’s not chance it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The locals are doing what they can. People who have had to make the trip along the gravel-roads detour have brought in supplies for others: photocopier paper for a veterinarian clinic; a meat order for the Wickaninnish; some tropical fish for someone who had ordered them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Port Alberni opened emergency shelters on June 6, they expected around 30 people. They ended up housing more than 200 stranded people that night, including school groups. When word got out about the high demand, volunteers came out of the woodwork, dropping off supplies, including toys and colouring books.\n",
      "\n",
      "The talk now must turn, and has turned, to building a viable alternative. Not another highway, necessarily. But perhaps widening and paving a second route to make it safer and more accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Global warming is a thing,” says Erika Greenland, who owns a Tofino property management and cleaning company for vacation rentals. “I’d love to see something put in place for our community at the end of the road, with a better alternate route planned for situations like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This desire is being made clear to provincial officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will be consistently pursuing this going forward and we have over the years as well, but definitely with a new energy,” says Port Alberni Mayor Sharie Minions, a spokesperson for the Emergency Operations Centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "This problem is only going to intensify. Over the weekend, the Donnie Creek wildfire in northeastern B.C. was declared the largest in the province’s recorded history. It is dangerously close to the Alaska Highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "A viable alternate route for communities at risk of being cut off by the effects of climate change should not be optional. Nor should it only be available to those who can afford vehicles that can withstand rough roads, or have bank accounts that allow them to fly.\n"

      "['Saleen Martin'] 2023-06-23 00:00:00 'I instantly fell in love': Florida firefighter adopts baby found in Safe Haven Baby Box\n",
      "\n",
      "A Florida firefighter who spent 10 years trying to have a baby of his own finally got his wish in January, and it happened on the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened on January 2 when a baby girl was dropped off at a Safe Haven Baby Box at the MLK First Responder Campus in Ocala, about 80 miles northwest of Orlando.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alarm went off at 2 a.m., said the firefighter who eventually adopted the baby girl as his own. While mostly everyone at the station was asleep, he and another Ocala Fire Rescue employee set out to see what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firefighter who adopted the child has chosen to remain anonymous to protect his family’s privacy, but he recalled opening the box, revealing a baby girl wearing a pink beanie and onesie. She had a matching blanket and next to her was a pink bottle, he told USA TODAY.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew immediately that he wanted to raise her as his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I walked into the front office where the box is located, I opened it and saw my beautiful daughter laying in it,” he wrote in an email.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Safe Haven Baby Box program has locations in Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boxes are located outside of fire departments and emergency response buildings. They have silent alarms so people can drop off babies “no questions asked,” according to the program’s website.\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby girl in Florida, eventually named Zoey, was the 23rd baby dropped off nationwide since 2017, according to the Ocala StarBanner, part of the USA TODAY network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoption: 'Where I was supposed to be': US man taken as infant in illegal Chilean adoption meets lost family\n",
      "\n",
      "Abortion laws: Mississippi's anti-abortion pregnancy centers won. Now they're preparing for more babies\n",
      "\n",
      "Locking eyes with the baby girl told him all he needed to know\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the alarm went off and he headed outside to open the box, the firefighter picked the child up and walked her into the station.\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked his teammate to get the rest of the crew together so they could see if she needed medical treatment but she didn’t seem to be in distress at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed fine until he put her on a table to do a medical exam, so he picked her up again and held her until the ambulance arrived to take her to the hospital. At this point, the pair locked eyes, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I instantly fell in love with her,” he said. “As soon as she locked eyes with me, she instantly stopped crying and she didn’t stop looking at me until I delivered her to the emergency room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He and his wife have been trying to have a child of their own for 10 years. The couple has undergone fertility treatments and looked into adoption as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was initially going to write down his contact information and give it to the ambulance crew but his own teammates pushed him to accompany the baby to the hospital. Once there, doctors suggested he write a note as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the baby was taken to the hospital, he called his wife to tell her what happened and burst into tears. The couple tried not to get too excited because they didn’t want to be let down, he recalled.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife contacted the hospital’s case worker and an emergency room doctor also hand-delivered his note to the hospital social worker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors who treated her said she was less than 12 hours old and likely wasn’t born at a hospital. She spent two days in the NICU under observation before the firefighter and his wife were able to take her home, her father said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, his wife received a phone call that they could eventually take the child home, but not before taking care of a few tasks such as finding a pediatrician, taking a few safety classes, hiring a lawyer and lastly, naming the baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had about an hour to come up with a name on her own since her husband was at the scene of a fire. She texted him a bunch of names and after looking them over, he thought of the name himself: Zoey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her adoption was finalized just a few months later, the Ocala StarBanner reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adjusting to life with her mom and dad\n",
      "\n",
      "During her first few weeks with the family, baby Zoey was pretty observant and sleepy, her parents told the Ocala StarBanner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that she’s nearly 6 months old, she tries to grab everything she can and has quite the appetite, her mother said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is doing very well and reaching all her milestones,” her father said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s quite curious and loves to play with her toys, he said. She also loves when her parents read to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The couple told the Ocala StarBanner they will tell Zoey about her adoption once she’s older and if she decides she wants to learn more about her biological family, she’s welcome to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firefighter has no information about the baby girl's biological parents. His wife told the Ocala StarBanner she's glad the Safe Haven Baby Box exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also has a message for the baby girl's birth mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has \"a lot of respect for her\" and wants her to know the baby girl is \"thriving.\"\n",

But the Republicans campaigning for the presidency have largely downplayed the issue and rejected policies that would slow rising temperatures.\n",

      "His response reflected what has become a pattern among Republican officials. Many of the candidates acknowledge that climate change is real, in contrast to party members’ years of outright denial.

      "['David French'] 2023-06-25 00:00:00 What is the legal foundation for women’s sports? It’s a simple question with a surprisingly complex answer. After all, the most potent federal statute supporting parallel men’s and women’s sports leagues would appear — on its face — to also prohibit separate leagues. Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 states, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The act contains explicit exceptions — such as permitting fraternities and sororities and beauty pageants and protecting the liberty of religious educational institutions — but its language tracks that of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI prohibits race discrimination in federally funded educational programs using virtually identical language, declaring, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of athletics, however, these two statutes have traditionally worked in remarkably different ways. Race segregation in athletic programs is a legal and cultural taboo. There are no legally segregated white and Black football leagues, for example, and if a school decided to create a Black league and a white league, it would face an immediate civil rights complaint. Excluding a football player from a team simply because of his race is unlawful discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is not the case when it comes to sex. The result of Title IX was not the large-scale creation of coed sports leagues, where men and women have an equal opportunity to compete in the same events, where the best man or woman makes the team, and the best man or woman wins the race. Instead, Title IX has resulted in the expansion of women’s sports into an enormous, separate and parallel apparatus, where women by the millions compete against one another, winning women’s titles in women’s leagues.\n"

      "['David French'] 2023-06-25 00:00:00 What is the legal foundation for women’s sports? It’s a simple question with a surprisingly complex answer. After all, the most potent federal statute supporting parallel men’s and women’s sports leagues would appear — on its face — to also prohibit separate leagues. Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 states, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The act contains explicit exceptions — such as permitting fraternities and sororities and beauty pageants and protecting the liberty of religious educational institutions — but its language tracks that of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI prohibits race discrimination in federally funded educational programs using virtually identical language, declaring, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of athletics, however, these two statutes have traditionally worked in remarkably different ways. Race segregation in athletic programs is a legal and cultural taboo. There are no legally segregated white and Black football leagues, for example, and if a school decided to create a Black league and a white league, it would face an immediate civil rights complaint. Excluding a football player from a team simply because of his race is unlawful discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is not the case when it comes to sex. The result of Title IX was not the large-scale creation of coed sports leagues, where men and women have an equal opportunity to compete in the same events, where the best man or woman makes the team, and the best man or woman wins the race. Instead, Title IX has resulted in the expansion of women’s sports into an enormous, separate and parallel apparatus, where women by the millions compete against one another, winning women’s titles in women’s leagues.\n"

      "Canada surpassed the record for area burned by wildfires in a single year Monday as hundreds of fires continued to blaze in almost every province and territory.\n",

      "The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday afternoon that 76,129 square kilometres of forest and other land has burned since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometres, according to the National Forestry Database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said he wasn’t “looking to break any records” but acknowledged it was likely coming. “Unfortunately the fire season this year started earlier and has been more widespread across the country than in recent memory,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took less than six months to surpass the previous record for an entire year. And in 1989, more than 11,000 different fires combined to create the total, with an average size of about seven square kilometres. This year, there have been less than 3,000 fires so far, but they have averaged about 26 square kilometres in size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently there are 490 fires burning nationally, with 255 of them considered to be out of control.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Quebec, where nearly a quarter of the fires are burning, heavy smoke grounded water bombers in the province’s north Monday and caused widespread smog warnings farther south.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicolas Vigneault, a spokesman for the province’s forest fire prevention agency, said the smoke had reduced visibility, making it impossible for some water bombers and helicopters to take off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do as (many) operations as we can in the field with the firefighters, and in the air with the planes and helicopters,” he said. “But our priority is the security of everybody, and the smoke is a challenge right now, and it’s been a challenge over the last two or three days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he said heavy rain and some wind is expected in the most affected parts of the province in the coming days, which should allow operations to resume “almost normally.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While no towns are under immediate risk of burning, the fires have forced thousands of Quebecers from their homes. That includes the 2,000 residents of Lebel-sur-Quevillon, parts of Val-d’Or and Senneterre and some Indigenous communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Monday afternoon update, the fire prevention agency said the fire burning near Lebel-sur-Quevillon remained out of control, and had grown to more than 4,400 square kilometres.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Again yesterday, the lack of visibility for our aircraft had an impact on fire suppression operations” at the Lebel-sur-Quevillon fire, the agency wrote on its Facebook page. “We did some tests, but no plane or helicopter could complete a mission due to the dense smoke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It said “significant” rain was expected in the northwest of the province beginning late Monday or Tuesday, but strong winds ahead of the wet weather could make fire conditions challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cree Nation of Mistissini announced late Sunday that it was asking all remaining community members to evacuate the area due to a fire threatening nearby Highway 167.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dryness index is 100, the highest that can be recorded, and the intensity of the fire is really high,” read one of a series of posts on the community’s Facebook page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities noted that the forest fire agency was unable to get images of the fire due to low visibility, which made it hard to track its progress. A plan was in the works to protect the community by widening firebreaks, bringing in water tankers to combat spot fires and putting sprinklers at the entrance to the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, heavy smoke forced the Cree community of Waswanipi to announce plans to evacuate another 50 residents, including seniors, pregnant women and infants under one year old.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a video update late Sunday, Chief Irene Neeposh asked residents who remained in the community to keep their children inside, keep their doors and windows closed and wear a proper-fitting mask while outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are strongly, I repeat strongly, advising that you do not let your children play outside,” she said. “The smoke being this dense is extremely toxic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was better news in three small communities near the Ontario border, where officials said the more than 300 residents of Val-Paradis, Beaucanton and Lac Pajegasque could go home after being forced to leave on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Atikamekw of Opitciwan, about 600 kilometres north of Montreal, also announced that residents of the area who had been evacuated would be allowed to return on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada issued smog warnings for much of the province, including Montreal and Quebec City, due to poor air quality caused by fine particles in the air. The department also issued special weather statements for many of those same cities, forecasting 20 to 40 millimetres of rain in some areas, with more than 50 mm possible in thunderstorms.\n",
      "\n",
      "By late afternoon, the smog warnings had been lifted for the south of the province between Quebec City and Montreal, though they remained in place in the Gatineau region near Ottawa, the Abitibi region in the northwest and the Lac-St-Jean region north of Quebec City.\n"

      "\n",
      "Thick smoke clogged the sky in Chicago early Tuesday, with a gray haze limiting visibility, and a faint burning smell filled the air as residents commuted to work. In downtown Detroit, smoke could be seen lingering over the skyline and the National Weather Service issued an air quality advisory for the city until Wednesday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chicago and Detroit held the top two rankings for worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir’s Air Quality Index. The two Midwest metropolitans alternated between the \"unhealthy\" and \"very unhealthy\" categories through Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unhealthy levels of pollutants from the smoke spread across parts of the Great Lakes Region surrounding Chicago, including most of Wisconsin and parts of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, according to tracker AirNow.gov.\n",

      "Meanwhile, more smoky air is headed back New Yorkers' way. Gov. Kathy Hochul warned air quality is expected to reach unhealthy levels in parts of western and central New York and eastern Lake Ontario on Wednesday and Thursday.\n",

      "That means anyone in a sensitive group – including young children, older adults or those with heart and lung disease – should stay indoors for any physical activity, and everyone else should limit the amount of time they are active outdoors.\n",

      "\n",
      "Why is the air quality so bad in Chicago and Detroit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Air quality is unhealthy due to the level of particulates in the air from Canadian wildfires, which have drifted into the U.S. at various points in the last several weeks. Zachary Yack, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Chicago, said wind patterns were largely driving where the smoky air goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smoke is affecting a vast area of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and will blow downward into the Lower Peninsula's southern region. The dense smoke has also been moving into other southern regions of the state and sensitive groups were advised to avoid outdoor activities on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low pressure over the eastern Great Lakes is also causing the smoke to drift through northern Michigan, and across southern Wisconsin and Chicago, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hochul said on Tuesday masks would be available for free to New Yorkers ahead of expected unhealthy air later this week. She announced earlier this month the state would have 1 million free N95 masks available amid hazardous air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "When will Chicago air quality get better?\n",
      "\n",
      "The smoky air and haze is expected to linger in the region Tuesday and overnight, but should be slowly pushed south and west throughout Tuesday, and gradually diminish in coverage on Wednesday, Yack said.\n",

      "\"Some spots may still see some white concentration of the smoke, hint of the smoke smell maybe into tomorrow morning, but most of it should be a thinning trend as we go forward in time,\" Yack said.\n",

      "Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy on Tuesday issued an air quality alert for the entire state, while in Chicago – where the air quality has been categorized “unhealthy” by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency – officials are urging young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors.\n",

      "“Just driving into the zoo … you could just see around the buildings, kind of just haze,” said Shelly Woinowski, who was visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.\n",

      "Some day care centres in the Chicago area have told parents that their children will remain indoors Tuesday due to the poor air quality, while one youth sports club says it adjusted its activities to add more time indoors.\n",

      "“We recommend children, teens, seniors, people with heart or lung disease, and individuals who are pregnant avoid strenuous activities and limit their time outdoors,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a release. “As these unsafe conditions continue, the city will continue to provide updates and take swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, massive fires burning stretches of Canadian forests blanketed the northeastern United States and the Great Lakes region, turning the air yellowish grey, and prompting warnings for people to stay inside and keep windows closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The small particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it’s important to limit outdoor activities as much as possible to avoid breathing in these particles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fires in northern Quebec and low pressure over the eastern Great Lakes are sending smoke through northern Michigan, and across southern Wisconsin and Chicago, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson added that a north wind would push the smoke further south, moving into Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky later Tuesday and overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued an air quality alert for southern, east central, and northeast Minnesota until Thursday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jackson also noted that southwestern Michigan has high air quality index, over 200 on a 500-point index. That’s considered unhealthy for everyone because it denotes high levels of fine particle pollution, or PM2.5 particles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Until the fires are out, there’s a risk,” Jackson said. “If there’s any north component to the wind, there’s a chance it’ll be smoky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In early June, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that hundreds of American firefighters and support personnel have been in Canada since May, and called attention to the fires as a reminder of the impacts of climate change.\n",

      "The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, according to Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.\n",

      "Priti Marwah, who was beginning a run along the city’s lakefront, describes the haze in Chicago Tuesday as “bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like, you can smell it bad,” she said. “I run a hundred miles a week, so this is going to be dangerous today. You can feel it … just even parking right there and coming out, I can feel it in my lungs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The smoky haze didn’t appear to be impacting flights into and out of Detroit Metropolitan Airport or Milwaukee Mitchell Airport on Tuesday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re not seeing anything significant in terms of delays or cancellations due to the smoke,” said Milwaukee Mitchell Airport spokesperson Summer Hegranes. “(But) you can definitely see the smoke.”\n"

      "\n",
      "First, let’s take a step back. Global average temperatures have increased because of the unchecked burning of coal, oil and gas for 150 years. That has created the conditions for more frequent and intense heat waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "That extra heat in the atmosphere has created a greater likelihood of extreme, sometimes catastrophic, weather all over the world. While that doesn’t mean the same extremes in the same places all the time, certain places are more susceptible to certain disasters, by virtue of geography. Australia could see more intense drought. Low-lying islands are projected to experience higher storm surges as sea levels rise.\n",

      "Eastern Canada, which erupted in extraordinary blazes, is projected to be wetter, on average, especially in winter. The projections are less clear for summers, when soil moisture is important for creating fire conditions, according to Park Williams, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, in a dry year, the extra heat is likely to aggravate fire risks. That’s what happened this year in parts of Quebec. Snow melted early. Spring was unusually dry. Trees turned to tinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Northeastern United States is also projected to be wetter in the coming years. But as Ellen L. Mecray, the eastern regional climate services director at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said, “We have also been experiencing seasonal droughts more often, in part due to increasing temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and loss of soil moisture.”\n",

      "Rising average temperatures increase the chances of more frequent and intense heat waves. That’s especially risky for people who work outdoors or who cannot afford air-conditioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, for coastal areas of the Northeast, there’s the risk of sea level rise. That means flooding dangers affecting millions of people. Cities have long been warned to prepare by improving drainage, opening up floodplains, planting shade trees and encouraging better insulation for buildings.\n",

      "\n",
      "In Western states, the wildfire season is already longer because of higher temperatures, drought and earlier snowmelt. By midcentury, the assessment concluded, the area burned there could at least double.\n",

      "\n",
      "The federal government launched its National Adaptation Strategy on Tuesday, calling it a plan that would help reduce risk and build climate-resilient communities at a time when thousands of Canadians are on evacuation order because of wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategy, an updated version of a document released in November, 2022, focuses on five areas: disaster resilience, health and well-being, nature and biodiversity, infrastructure and economy and workers. It includes actions such as flood mapping, wildfire mitigation and prevention activities and programs to protect Canadians from extreme heat events.\n",
      "\n",
      "In announcing the plan, Ottawa said it had invested more than $6.5-billion in adaptation since 2015, including $2-billion since late 2022 to implement the National Adaptation Strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the total tab for the adaptation strategy is a moving target, with experts saying billions will be required to strengthen roads, dams and other infrastructure and invest in mitigation measures ranging from urban cooling centres to wildfire-fighting equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We see more severe climate impact with each passing year, with each passing season,” Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said Tuesday at a press conference to launch the strategy. “While we must reduce our emissions to keep the climate from getting worse, we must also make our communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement was made at Vancouver city hall, where federal, provincial and city politicians, as well as Indigenous leaders, spoke of their support for the national plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the skies were clear and sunny, the threat of past and current extreme weather events loomed large.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal Minister of Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair opened his remarks by noting that, as of Tuesday, there were 492 wildfires burning across Canada, with 258 out of those deemed out of control. About 7.7 million hectares of forest have burned to date this year, making 2023 Canada’s worst wildfire season on record.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we have witnessed so far this year must strengthen our resolve to take action and to enhance community strength so we can move from disaster risk to resilience,” Mr. Blair said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stronger roads, bridges, sewers; improved broadband services and a national alert system are all part of the strategy, Mr. Blair said.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2030, the average annual losses from disasters is forecast to reach $15.4-billion, Ottawa said Tuesday in a press release. But mitigation efforts can help reduce those costs, in theory paying for themselves: implementing new flooding and wildfire guidelines and standards for new construction could save Canada an estimated $4.7-billion a year, or nearly $12 for every $1 invested.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the strategy is a federal document, issues such as building codes fall under provincial and territorial jurisdiction. Ottawa says it plans to work with provinces and territories to develop “bilateral action plans” to implement the strategy and will also work with First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities on Indigenous climate programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blair Feltmate is head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo and a member of an advisory table for the adaptation strategy. The strengths of the new document include its focus on wildfires, floods and extreme heat; near-term, verifiable targets and its call for an “all hands on deck” approach, Mr. Feltmate said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The targets include, for example, that 50 per cent of Canadians have taken concrete actions to prepare for climate change risks facing their households by 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "The risk, though, is that the plan isn’t executed and joins other well-crafted, ambitious strategies on the shelf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Historically, Canada has committed to climate plans that were very good and then not followed through on them,” Mr. Feltmate said. “We’ve got to hold our feet to the fire in terms of making sure we follow through – because historically, we have not done so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But extreme-weather impacts, including this year’s forest fires and the heat-related deaths of more than 600 people in B.C. in a 2021 heat dome, have become impossible to ignore, increasing the possibility that mitigation becomes a priority, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryan Ness, director of adaptation with the Canadian Climate Institute, called the strategy a positive step but said results will depend on how well Ottawa implements its targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now we need to see the road map – what does the federal government need to do, and how do they have to work with other levels of government and other stakeholders, to make it happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition politicians criticized the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Liberal government has failed to provide solutions to mitigate the impact of natural disasters in 8 years. While these strategies make for great press releases, what Canadians really need are results,” said an e-mailed statement from the office of Dane Lloyd, the Conservative shadow minister for emergency preparedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal government must work with provinces to ensure resources are available across Canada to respond to disasters, the statement added.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, NDP environment and climate change critic Laurel Collins said the government’s track record is “littered with broken promises” and called for urgent funding for public projects that foster climate change mitigation.\n",

In Canada, smoke will migrate across Quebec and Ontario over the next few days, Environment and Climate Change Canada meteorologist Steven Flisfeder said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the U.S., the smoke is exacerbating air quality issues for poor and Black communities that already are more likely to live near polluting plants, and in rental housing with mould and other triggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detroit’s southwest side is home to a number of sprawling refineries and manufacturing plants. It is one of the poorest parts of the city. According to a 2022 report by the American Lung Association, the city’s and short-term particle pollution ranked among the worst in the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Being close to those refineries – that’s an environmental factor that’s difficult to control,” said Dr. Ruma Srivastava, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children’s Hospital of Michigan in Detroit. “It does increase their risk for asthma flareups. For them, it’s even more important to follow the (air quality safety) recommendations.”\n",

Milwaukee County’s population is 27.1% Black.\n",

      "In Chicago, where about 29% of the population is Black, Mayor Brandon Johnson urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors.

      "Minnesota issued a record 23rd air quality alert for the year through late Wednesday night, as smoky skies obscured the skylines of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana were among other states issuing air quality alerts, and cities including Louisville also advised people to limit prolonged or intense outdoor activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is particularly thick smoke,” Jackson, with the National Weather Service, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across Canada, 490 fires are burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 76,129 square kilometres (29,393 square miles) of land including forests has burned across Canada since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 75,596 square kilometres (29,187 square miles), according to the National Forestry Database.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As long as the fires are burning and the smoke is in the atmosphere it is going to be a concern not just for Canadians but Americans as well,” Flisfeder, the Canadian meteorologist, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The small particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it’s important to limit outdoor activities to avoid breathing in the particles.\n",

The agency says wildfire pollution level can fluctuate over time and can vary depending on the location, but air quality is expected to improve for some areas on Thursday night.

      "Millions in Canada and across the border in the United States remain blanketed by wildfire smoke from Quebec that has triggered low air quality warnings, forcing many indoors and cancelling a number of planned events. While there are signs of improvement, the smog is expected to persist for the next few days into the Canada Day long weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada warned of “high concentrations of fine particulate matter from the forest fires” on Thursday in the Greater Montreal area. However, the federal agency said concentrations will be “less significant” than last Sunday, when the air quality in Quebec’s biggest city was ranked worst in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ottawa, Environment Canada said the forest fire smoke is expected to last possibly through Friday and into the weekend. While in and around Toronto, the air quality improved on Thursday, just a day after the city claimed the ignominious title of worst air quality in the world, according to IQAir, a Swiss pollution technology company that monitors global air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "With nearly eight million hectares of forest already burned this year, 2023 is the worst wildfire season on record, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC). Last week, Canada and the United States replaced an “ad hoc” approach to helping each other battle forest fires with a formal agreement, after wildfire smoke from Canada affected millions with polluted air on the U.S. East Coast earlier in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detroit, Washington and Chicago were sitting on top of IQAir’s ranking for worst air quality in the world Thursday, with Minneapolis and New York also in the Top 10. Data from AirNow, a partnership of various U.S. agencies, showed that large swaths of the country, from the Midwest to the East Coast, were experiencing poor air quality owing to wildfire smoke from Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were about 500 active wildfires throughout Canada Thursday, CIFFC data showed, with more than 250 deemed out of control. Most of the fires were in Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada meteorologist Peter Kimbell said Thursday that strong winds allowed the smoke to travel far from Canada in recent days, but that weaker winds mean smoke is now expected to linger into the weekend for Montreal and Southern Quebec, although concentrations of fine particulate matter are expected to decrease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor air quality has led to the cancellation of cultural and sports events in recent days, including the Ironman triathlon of Mont-Tremblant, Que., Sunday and Toronto Jazz Festival shows Wednesday. The La Ronde amusement park in Montreal said in a statement Thursday that the opening act of L’International des Feux Loto-Québec, a fireworks competition, was cancelled based on a recommendation from public-health authorities owing to poor air quality. Also Thursday, organizers in Montreal said its Canada Day fireworks planned for Saturday night were cancelled, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "More wildfire activity could be triggered over the next few days as hot weather is expected in Northeastern Ontario and Northern Quebec, Mr. Kimbell said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Quebec, about 2,500 people remained under evacuation orders, although some communities like Lebel-sur-Quévillon are expected to be able to return home on the weekend, according to the Ministry of Public Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Western Canada, smoke lingered closer to the wildfires, with air quality statements affecting the territories and northern parts of the Prairies and Western Canada. “The southern parts of the provinces, where the population density is greatest, are not under air quality statements at this time, there’s no air quality issues,” Mr. Kimbell said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evacuation orders related to wildfires were issued earlier this week by B.C.’s Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and Takla First Nation, and several other communities were under evacuation alert in the Peace River Regional District and the District of Tumbler Ridge.\n",

      "['Doyle Rice'] 2023-07-01 00:00:00 'That’s going to be a problem': Summer 2023 is shaping up to be sweltering and smoky\n",
      "\n",
      "Show Caption Hide Caption Heat wave ups pressure on Texas power grid As a heat wave grips Texas, public appeals to stay hydrated and limit outdoor activities have come with another ask of the state's nearly 30 million residents: Conserve electricity if possible as demand on the power grid is stretched. (June 27) (AP Video: Kendria LaFleur) AP\n",
      "\n",
      "Summer 2023 in the U.S. has started with deadly heat and dangerous air as heat domes and wildfire effects plague tens of millions of Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get used to it, experts say, as both the heat and the smoke are likely here to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the ongoing wildfires in Canada, which show no sign of ending, smoky air is set to be a regular, periodic occurrence down here in the U.S. throughout the rest of the summer, experts said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As long as those fires keep burning up there, that’s going to be a problem for us,\" said Weather Prediction Center forecast operations chief Greg Carbin. \"As long as there’s something to burn, there will be smoke we have to deal with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And as for the heat, if you're sick of it already, there's not much relief in sight: Federal forecasters are predicting a warmer-than-average summer for most of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smoke risk not likely to ease soon, thanks to stuck pattern\n",
      "\n",
      "An unusually persistent, stuck weather pattern, which continues to periodically funnel foul, smoke-filled air over U.S. cities from Chicago to Washington, shows no sign of changing or letting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While the fires are ongoing, you can expect to see these periodic bad air days,\" said University of Chicago atmospheric scientist Liz Moyer. \"And the only relief is either when the fires go out or when the weather pattern dies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the wildfire forecast from Canada remains grim: Current projections indicate the potential for continued \"higher-than-normal fire activity across most of the country throughout the 2023 wildland fire season, due to ongoing drought and long-range forecasts for warm temperatures,\" according to Natural Resources Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hot forecast for the rest of summer 2023\n",
      "\n",
      "A hot summer also seems likely, meteorologists say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, above-normal temperatures are expected throughout a majority of the U.S. during July, August and September, according to Climate Prediction Center meteorologist Brad Pugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pugh said the highest probabilities of above-normal temperatures are forecast across parts of California, the Pacific Northwest, the Great Basin, the Southwest, the Gulf Coast and the East. No parts of the country are expected to see cooler-than-average temperatures for the next three months, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heat wave easing in the South, for now\n",
      "\n",
      "The deadly heat that has scorched Texas for weeks now has finally eased, forecasters said, but with the nation entering the hottest month of the year this weekend, the heat is far from over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s relief from the extreme heat,” National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Jackson said. “It’s not really an end to a heat wave; it’s just an end to the extreme part of the heat wave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sweltering temperatures – which have been responsible for at least 14 deaths – were brought on by a heat dome parked over Texas that taxed the power grid and brought record highs to parts of the state, according to meteorologists.\n",
      "\n",
      "That heat dome has spread eastward, and by the weekend was expected to \"gradually weaken\" over the mid-South, the Weather Prediction Center said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the weather service on Saturday said sweltering temperatures are expected to continue in cities along the Gulf Coast, and Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast regions are expected to break their daily warmest nighttime low records through the weekend. Heat-related danger remains elevated due to the longevity of this heat wave, the weather service said.\n",
      "\n",
      "West will get in on the extreme heat\n",
      "\n",
      "A separate dome of heat has developed on the West Coast, and an excessive heat warning was in place in a wide swath in the central part of California, Jackson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the West will see hot, dry conditions forecast through the Fourth of July, raising concerns about the danger of fireworks shows and wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By this weekend there is a risk for record high temperatures exceeding 100 degrees … close to 110 degrees in the Central Valley of California,” Jackson said. “Then some of the more typical midsummer heat of getting above 115 degrees in the hottest areas of the Desert Southwest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "An excessive heat warning was in effect for much of the Desert Southwest for the weekend and temperatures are expected to climb well into the 110s, the weather service said. The risk of heat-related illnesses will be high through the weekend. That includes notorious hot spot Death Valley, California, which is forecast to see a high of 123 degrees by Sunday, the weather service said.\n",
      "\n",
      "July typically the hottest month of the year in the US\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not exactly news that it's hot in July: Climatologically speaking, July is the hottest month of the year for the contiguous United States, with an average temperature of 73.6 degrees, the National Centers for Environmental Information said. The average daytime high temperature is nearly 87 degrees, and the average nighttime low is about 60 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hottest July – and the hottest month overall – on record for the contiguous U.S. came in 1936 during the Dust Bowl. The July 1936 average temperature was 76.8 degrees, which is 3.2 degrees above the 20th-century average.\n",
      "\n",
      "The USA's hottest state, on average, in July is Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The July temperature for the contiguous United States has warmed at an average rate of 1.2 degrees per century since 1895. Since 1950, the rate of change is double that at 2.4 degrees per century.\n",

      "Smoke and low air quality warnings persisted on the weekend, affecting millions in North American cities and upending Canada Day celebrations in some areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment Canada warned of “high concentrations of fine particulate matter from the forest fires” on Saturday in the Greater Montreal area, conditions that it said “may continue until Sunday.” Similar warnings were in place for much of Quebec and southeastern Ontario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quebec’s largest city was still experiencing among the worst air quality in the world on Canada Day, according to according to rankings from IQAir, a Swiss pollution technology company.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ottawa, the agency said smoke is expected to last possibly into Saturday evening. There was no Environment Canada alert in and around Toronto on Saturday, although the city experienced air quality issues earlier in the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "With more than eight million hectares of forest already burned this year, 2023 is the worst wildfire season on record, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC). In June, Canada and the United States replaced an “ad hoc” approach to helping each other battle forest fires with a formal agreement, after wildfire smoke from Canada affected millions with polluted air on the U.S. East Coast earlier that month.\n",
      "\n",
      "South of the border, although the situation improved in recent days, air quality remained low for large swaths of the U.S., from the Midwest to the East Coast, owing to wildfire smoke from Canada, according to data from AirNow, a partnership of various U.S. agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cities like Washington, D.C., Chicago, Minneapolis, and New York were still in IQAir’s top 15 for worst air quality Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were more than 500 active wildfires throughout Canada on Saturday, CIFFC data showed, with more than half deemed out of control. Most of the fires were in Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor air quality and wildfires have led to the cancellation of cultural and sports events in recent days, and affected preparations for Canada Day celebrations in some areas. Fireworks were cancelled in Quebec City and Montreal “in solidarity with the ongoing forest fires in Quebec,” organizers said, while they were still expected to be part of the show in Ottawa and Toronto.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Quebec, where thousands were still under evacuation orders earlier this week, “weather conditions in the last few days reduced the intensity of several forest fires” and most evacuees were able to return home, according to the Ministry of Public Security.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Western Canada, smoke lingered closer to the wildfires, with air quality statements affecting the territories and northern parts of the Prairies and Western provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kee Tas Kee Now Tribal Council issued a mandatory evacuation alert Friday night for the Little Buffalo area in northern Alberta after high winds accelerated the growth of a wildfire. In B.C., evacuation orders were issued earlier this week by the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Takla First Nation, and several other communities were under evacuation alert in the Peace River Regional District and the District of Tumbler Ridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the peak of evacuations in May and June, tens of thousands were forced out of their homes mainly in Alberta, Quebec and Nova Scotia.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, the federal government launched its National Adaptation Strategy, saying it would help reduce risk and build climate-resilient communities facing direct consequences of worsening global warming, including increased wildfire risk.\n"

      "\n",
      "Shannon Hautamaki was loath to cancel end-of-school activities for her 5-year-old son, Ian. But Ian has severe asthma and had been to the emergency room five times over the last two years, and she anticipated a flare-up from the smoke. So after he attended the picnic, she did not let Ian leave the house; she supplemented his regular medications with nebulizer treatments and ran air purifiers full blast until the skies cleared.\n",
      "\n",
      "As physicians who specialize in respiratory health and children, our first thought last week as wildfire smoke again engulfed parts of the United States was of little ones Ian’s age and younger because their developing lungs are particularly vulnerable to smoke inhalation. And we worried most about the millions of children in this country with asthma who may not have access to the prescription medications they need or to a clean indoor space to breathe. This new recurring threat of terrible air quality from wildfire smoke is one big reason we believe that for a child born today, climate change may be the single greatest determinant of health over the course of their lives.\n"

Experts advise higher-risk individuals to take immediate steps to protect themselves when the risk level of the AQHI increases.

Levels of 7 to 10 are considered high risk, and anything above 10 is considered very high risk.\n",

So after he attended the picnic, she did not let Ian leave the house; she supplemented his regular medications with nebulizer treatments and ran air purifiers full blast until the skies cleared.\n",

This new recurring threat of terrible air quality from wildfire smoke is one big reason we believe that for a child born today, climate change may be the single greatest determinant of health over the course of their lives.\n"

      "\n",
      "Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd.’s OR-T chief executive Sandeep Singh was fired from the mining and streaming royalty company he helped turn around after clashing with the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Montreal-based Osisko on Wednesday announced that Mr. Singh, who had only been in the role since 2020, had left the company effective immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company gave little explanation for his exit, other than saying that the independent directors concluded that change was necessary “to best position Osisko for continued long-term success.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares in the company immediately lost 10 per cent of their value amid the uncertainty and a vacuum of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko was founded in 2014 by veteran mining executive Sean Roosen. Mr. Singh, a former long-time investment banker, was named CEO in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview, Mr. Singh said that he was terminated after butting heads with the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was a clash there. I mean they fired me, so clearly there’s something there that wasn’t working.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko declined to comment for this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Mr. Singh admits there were problems with the board, he strongly defended his record as CEO, and made it clear he was not fired for cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Despite the abrupt tone and nature of the release, I was terminated without cause, and I am extremely proud of the work I did there, and of the team I led for the past three and a half years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Mr. Singh’s leadership, Osisko, which had previously underperformed its peers, started to outperform. This year, the company’s share performance has handily beaten even Franco-Nevada Corp., the longstanding king of the royalty sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he started at Osisko, Mr. Singh said that “very few people, if anyone on the street, had anything positive to say about the company.” Osisko, he says, has since come 180 degrees. “It was an immense amount of work to rebuild the trust of the market, and that’s my legacy,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Singh’s termination coincided with a weakening power of the company’s founder and visionary Mr. Roosen, who is moving from executive chairman to chairman. That role will see him take a less hands-on role in the day-to-day running of the company, and step into a position that traditionally carries far less compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko’s lead independent director Joanne Ferstman said in a release this week that the change in duties for Mr. Roosen was part of the company’s commitment to improved governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The change for Roosen also comes after he received a lukewarm reception at the annual general meeting, garnering only 77.9 per cent approval from shareholders, the weakest of any board member. Mr. Singh by comparison received 99.6 per cent approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Roosen is best-known for his role in founding, developing and selling the massive Malartic mine in Quebec, one of Canada’s biggest gold mines. One of Osisko Gold Royalties’ most important assets continues to be its royalty on Malartic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically Osisko’s business model deviated from its competitors because in addition to purchasing royalties and streams, it also took direct stakes in junior miners, a strategy that hasn’t always worked. Under Mr. Singh’s leadership, the company has concentrated increasingly on becoming a pure play royalty company.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Mr. Singh admits he expected a strong effort from his team when he was CEO, he bats away any notion that he was a bad boss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I worked people hard, but I worked myself even harder,” he said. “I consider those people my friends, and I hope, and I think that they would say the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before joining Osisko Mr. Singh had a 15 year career as a mining banker with BMO Nesbitt Burns, Dundee Securities and Maxit Capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko named Paul Martin, former CEO of Detour Gold Corp. as interim chief executive as it commenced a search for a permanent replacement for Mr. Singh.\n"

      "['Niall Mcgee', 'Mining Reporter'] 2023-07-07 11:46:03-04:00 Open this photo in gallery: Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd.’s chief executive Sandeep Singh was fired after clashing with the board.Agnieszka Stalkoper\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd.’s OR-T chief executive Sandeep Singh was fired from the mining and streaming royalty company he helped turn around after clashing with the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Montreal-based Osisko on Wednesday announced that Mr. Singh, who had only been in the role since 2020, had left the company effective immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company gave little explanation for his exit, other than saying that the independent directors concluded that change was necessary “to best position Osisko for continued long-term success.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares in the company immediately lost 10 per cent of their value amid the uncertainty and a vacuum of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko was founded in 2014 by veteran mining executive Sean Roosen. Mr. Singh, a former long-time investment banker, was named CEO in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview, Mr. Singh said that he was terminated after butting heads with the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was a clash there. I mean they fired me, so clearly there’s something there that wasn’t working.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko declined to comment for this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Mr. Singh admits there were problems with the board, he strongly defended his record as CEO, and made it clear he was not fired for cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Despite the abrupt tone and nature of the release, I was terminated without cause, and I am extremely proud of the work I did there, and of the team I led for the past three and a half years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Mr. Singh’s leadership, Osisko, which had previously underperformed its peers, started to outperform. This year, the company’s share performance has handily beaten even Franco-Nevada Corp., the longstanding king of the royalty sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he started at Osisko, Mr. Singh said that “very few people, if anyone on the street, had anything positive to say about the company.” Osisko, he says, has since come 180 degrees. “It was an immense amount of work to rebuild the trust of the market, and that’s my legacy,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Singh’s termination coincided with a weakening power of the company’s founder and visionary Mr. Roosen, who is moving from executive chairman to chairman. That role will see him take a less hands-on role in the day-to-day running of the company, and step into a position that traditionally carries far less compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko’s lead independent director Joanne Ferstman said in a release this week that the change in duties for Mr. Roosen was part of the company’s commitment to improved governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The change for Roosen also comes after he received a lukewarm reception at the annual general meeting, garnering only 77.9 per cent approval from shareholders, the weakest of any board member. Mr. Singh by comparison received 99.6 per cent approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Roosen is best-known for his role in founding, developing and selling the massive Malartic mine in Quebec, one of Canada’s biggest gold mines. One of Osisko Gold Royalties’ most important assets continues to be its royalty on Malartic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically Osisko’s business model deviated from its competitors because in addition to purchasing royalties and streams, it also took direct stakes in junior miners, a strategy that hasn’t always worked. Under Mr. Singh’s leadership, the company has concentrated increasingly on becoming a pure play royalty company.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Mr. Singh admits he expected a strong effort from his team when he was CEO, he bats away any notion that he was a bad boss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I worked people hard, but I worked myself even harder,” he said. “I consider those people my friends, and I hope, and I think that they would say the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before joining Osisko Mr. Singh had a 15 year career as a mining banker with BMO Nesbitt Burns, Dundee Securities and Maxit Capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Osisko named Paul Martin, former CEO of Detour Gold Corp. as interim chief executive as it commenced a search for a permanent replacement for Mr. Singh.\n"

      "['Nicole Poell'] 2023-07-10 00:00:00 Northwestern fires football coach Pat Fitzgerald amid hazing scandal In explaining his decision to fire football coach Pat Fitzgerald, Northwestern president said the hazing was \"widespread and clearly not a secret within the program.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Northwestern head football coach Pat Fitzgerald was fired on Monday after several former players revealed details of hazing within the football program, and days after an independent investigation confirmed hazing activities \"widespread among football players.\" University president Michael Schill announced Fitzgerald's firing in a statement to the Northwestern community posted online.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Schill said the details of the investigation would remain confidential, he revealed some new information as he explained his decision to fire Fitzgerald:\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that 11 current or former players told investigators hazing had been ongoing, and he mentioned a new report from Monday, where more former players confirmed hazing \"was systemic dating back many years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Schill said nudity, forced participation and \"sexualized acts of a degrading nature\" were part of the hazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he said some players didn't think the hazing was harmful, he said others \"viewed it as causing significant harm with long-term consequences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Schill explained what led to his decision, writing: \"The head coach is ultimately responsible for the culture of his team. The hazing we investigated was widespread and clearly not a secret within the program, providing Coach Fitzgerald with the opportunity to learn what was happening. Either way, the culture in Northwestern Football, while incredible in some ways, was broken in others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, the school had announced that Fitzgerald had been suspended for two weeks without pay after an independent investigation led by Maggie Hickey, former Illinois inspector general, found hazing claims \"largely supported\" by evidence. Her investigation began last December after the university received a complaint in November claiming that hazing had taken place in the locker room and at “Camp Kenosha” in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where the program has held preseason camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to an executive summary released Friday, the \"investigation team determined that the complainant’s claims were largely supported by the evidence gathered during the investigation, including separate and consistent first-person accounts from current and former players.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigation \"did not uncover evidence pointing to specific misconduct by any individual football player or coach\" but found that \"participation in or knowledge of the hazing activities was widespread across football players.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitzgerald said in a statement Friday that he \"was not aware of the alleged incidents.\" Monday night he repeated that he had no knowledge of any hazing in a statement released to ESPN. Fitzgerald said he was \"surprised when I learned that the president of Northwestern unilaterally revoked our agreement without any prior notification and subsequently terminated my employment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He added that he has hired legal counsel \"to take the necessary steps to protect my rights in accordance with the law.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a story published Saturday in The Daily Northwestern, a former Northwestern football player alleged that some of the hazing was sexual in nature, and he provided disturbing details. He claimed that upperclassmen punished younger players who made mistakes in games and practices. The ritual was called \"running.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a shocking experience as a freshman to see your fellow freshman teammates get ran, but then you see everybody bystanding in the locker room,\" the unidentified former player told The Daily Northwestern. \"It's just a really abrasive and barbaric culture that has permeated throughout that program for years on end now.\" Another unnamed former player corroborated the claims with the Daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another report in The Daily Northwestern on Monday, three players alleged that there was a racist culture within the football program.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National College Players Association, which worked with Northwestern football players in an effort to unionize, is calling for more investigations into the allegations of hazing and racism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ramogi Huma, the Founder and President of the College Athletes Players Association, said he was not aware of any of the allegations or related allegations when he worked with Northwestern's football players in the effort to unionize the team in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitzgerald, 48, spent 17 seasons as the Wildcats' head coach. He won five bowls and had three 10-win seasons, something virtually unheard of at Northwestern when he got the job before the 2006 season, after the death of head coach Randy Walker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitzgerald is the winningest coach in the program's history and had agreed to a 10-year contract extension with Northwestern through the 2030 season.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wildcats went 1-11 last season, ranking last in the Big 10 in scoring offense and turnover margin, and it was one of four FBS schools to win one game in 2022. Colorado, South Florida and UMass were the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitzgerald, who won the 2018 Big Ten Coach of the Year award, finishes his Northwestern career with a 110-101 record. He also was a decorated player during his time with the Wildcats, winning two Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year awards, and being named a consensus All-American in 1995 and 1996, leading Northwestern to a pair of conference championships and a Rose Bowl appearance.\n"

      "['David Wallace-Wells'] 2023-07-12 00:00:00 It didn’t even seem that freakish, all things considered — we see so many more climate-fueled disasters now, with global average temperatures breaking records every day recently. There were terrifying floods this week in Himachal Pradesh, in India, where several bridges collapsed and others carrying dozens of cars and trucks seemed about to. Japan experienced the “heaviest rain ever,” and in Spain, floodwaters carried cars backward through traffic at rapid speeds, their drivers simply watching powerless from the roof, where they’d taken refuge when the water began filling the cabin. A monthslong heat wave centered on Texas and Mexico and spread outward as far as Miami, which, as of Monday, had reached heat indexes north of 100 degrees for 30 straight days. In Death Valley in California, this week temperatures may reach or surpass the global record of 130 degrees Fahrenheit, set just in 2021. In El Paso, there hasn’t been a day that didn’t hit 100 for weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Off the coast of Florida, the water was nearly as warm as a hot tub — 95 degrees according to one buoy, 97 degrees according to another. It was just last month when life-threatening heat indexes as high as 125 simply parked in Puerto Rico for days on end. According to a coral bleaching forecast published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is likely to be bleaching across the entire Caribbean this summer. It’s not clear how much will survive. According to some estimates, as much as 50 percent of the world’s oceans will experience marine heat wave conditions this summer; normally the figure is about 10 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also the Canadian fires, which continue burning along an off-the-charts trajectory, though the smoke has more recently dispersed to the north and across to Europe rather than directly into the airways of the American Northeast and Midwest. In the first 25 days of June, more land burned in Quebec than had burned there over the previous 20 years combined. Across Canada as a whole, more than 22 million acres have now burned, more than five times the record-shattering California fire season of 2020 and more than double the totals from the most destructive American seasons of the past 60 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with New York’s skies merely unseasonably gray, we’ve moved on. As my colleague David Gelles noted this week, writing from inside his own flooding home, recent research suggests we may come to accept weather extremes as normal within two years — a grim prophecy of accommodation to disaster as a form of adaptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A year ago, as potentially lethal wet-bulb temperatures swallowed parts of India and Pakistan where hundreds of millions lived, I wrote a long essay headlined “Can you even call deadly heat ‘extreme’ anymore?” This spring and summer, lethal heat swept the subcontinent again, delivering temperatures regularly above 110 degrees Fahrenheit but generating considerably less media attention in the West, though this time the official death toll was higher.\n"

      "\n",
      "Afire\n",
      "\n",
      "Written and directed by Christian Petzold\n",

      "\n",
      "Critic’s Pick\n",
      "\n",
      "German filmmaker Christian Petzold has made a career trading on big ideas – cinematic dialogues with history and culture that are long and winding and heavy and masterful. Think of 2018′s Transit, which adapted Anna Segher’s Second World War-era novel Transit Visa to tell the story of French refugees escaping Paris following an invasion, albeit in Petzold’s film the time period was distinctly contemporary. Or take 2014′s Phoenix, which twisted notions of identity and morality before landing on perhaps one of the finest final shots in 21st-century cinema so far. A Petzold production has been synonymous with investment, commitment and absorption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which isn’t to say that the director’s latest, Afire, is feather-light. The film centres on questions of creativity, the energy and discipline required to channel it, and what happens when we let it spin us in the wrong directions. But there is a certain levity to the movie – a breeziness, albeit one controlled and considered – that forces the film to stand apart from the established conception of the Petzold canon. It is a vacation from a filmography, an experience that might feel richer only once you’re a few days removed from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asteroid City tops our best movies of 2023 list\n",
      "\n",
      "Or maybe Afire simply feels like a detour from Petzold’s more favoured routes because it is about a vacation, or at least a retreat from the familiar. Opening on a rural back road near the Baltic Sea, the film finds sullen novelist Leon (Thomas Schubert) and photography student Felix (Langston Uibel) trying to reach the latter’s family cabin. The relationship between the two is initially vague – are they friends or, as an impromptu wrestling match hints at, something more? This thread hangs in the air until the pair arrive at their destination only to find that it’s already occupied by a guest double-booked by Felix’s mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially heard and not seen, Nadja (Paula Beer) is an alluring, mysterious, almost intimidating presence. Introduced with a kind of highly manufactured allure that Petzold typically reserves for his leading ladies (including Beer, who has now starred in three of the director’s films), Nadja doesn’t initially spell out what she’s doing here, preferring to just float from errand to meal to evening’s rest. Eventually, the trio form an unlikely household, which comes to include a handsome lifeguard named David (Enno Trebs) who may or may not be Nadja’s lover.\n",

      "Open this photo in gallery: Afire centres on questions of creativity, the energy and discipline required to channel it, and what happens when we let it spin us in the wrong directions.Christian Schulz/Schramm Film/Handout/Handout\n",
      "\n",
      "The environment is ripe for easy, countryside pleasure – a potent mix of sun and sex. Yet the retreat is threatened by two unwanted guests, of a sort. The first is Leon’s caustic self-absorption, large and overwhelming enough to be corporeal, with the writer so tormented by his latest novel that he thinks himself both above his companions and like the biggest failure in the world. The second is the threat of forest fires, which are gradually encroaching the surrounding countryside. Tensions flare, frustrations boil, and the heat, both metaphorical and literal, is dialled up when Leon’s literary editor arrives to go over his new draft.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the exception of Felix, whose motives for putting up with Leon for so long remain curiously unexplored, Petzold’s characters arrive onscreen fully formed and layered, further fleshed out by the film’s small cast of dedicated performers. Beer is as compelling and beguiling as ever, though it’s Schubert who truly dials into his antihero. Leon has the fussiness and unbearable self-doubt of a storyteller who is as unsure of his own life as he is that of his fiction, and it’s fascinating to watch Schubert work through that frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the film ends by confronting the promised tragedy of its title – perhaps too abruptly, for some audiences. But the dramedy of manners is as rich and rewarding an experience as any of Petzold’s more ambitious films. Afire arrives like a calm wind, and leaves with everything and everyone perfectly scorched.\n"

      "Brown dwarfs, sometimes called “failed stars,” are too small to attain the powerful gravity required to compress hydrogen to the point of nuclear fusion.

      "['Manohla Dargis', 'More About Manohla Dargis'] 2023-07-13 00:00:00 The German filmmaker Christian Petzold’s spiky and at times mordantly funny “Afire” is a tonic for moviegoers tired of nice, squishable, likable, relatable dull and dull characters. It’s a look — for starters — at a splenetic young writer who, during a stay in the country, waits for his publisher to weigh in on his unfortunately titled second novel “Club Sandwich.” He frets that it’s no good, though his arrogance is sturdier and more consuming than his doubts. Yet while the writer is boorish, he’s never insipid; he’s pleasurably bad company.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s far more to this lamentable creature as you learn, and would expect from Petzold. One of the most reliably interesting and surprising filmmakers working today, Petzold makes sharp, visually intelligent, psychologically sophisticated movies. He likes working in traditional genres that he bends to his own purposes while drawing on a range of cinematic traditions: classical Hollywood, the European art film, the avant-garde. He’s probably best known in the United States for “Barbara” (2012) and “Transit” (2019), atmospheric thrillers in which characters — one in East Germany, the other in a present-day Nazi-like limbo — seek to escape states of terror that are both apparatuses of power and conditions of being.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Afire” is lighter in tone and feeling. Petzold has said that, among other influences, he was inspired by the films of Éric Rohmer, as well as French and American coming-of-age stories set in summer. Yet he likes to mix it up, and “Afire” opens with a teasingly ominous sequence that finds the writer and a friend driving on a country road in a car that soon breaks down, leaving them stranded. By the time night falls, the tone has darkened, as have the surrounding woods, which now seems like a setting for one of those horror flicks in which nubile kids in cutoffs are sacrificed to the gods of cinema.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writer, Leon (Thomas Schubert), and his friend, Felix (Langston Uibel), make it relatively unscathed to their destination, a vacation home on Germany’s Baltic coast. Compact and inviting, the house is owned by Felix’s mother, and has two bedrooms and a leaky roof. There, the men will be alone while Leon waits for his publisher and Felix readies an art-school portfolio. When they arrive, though, they find that the mother has invited a third, a stranger to the men named Nadja (Paula Beer). She’s nowhere to be seen, but her traces — wine glasses on the table, discarded clothing on the floor — perfume the house.\n"

      "Article content There are 173 species of fireflies in North America that have been identified by scientists, and 29 are found in Canada, said Candace Fallon, a senior biologist with the American conservation group Xerces Society, which is lobbying the United States government to extend endangered status to fireflies. Fallon is the lead author of a study published in 2021 in the journal PLOS One, suggesting that up to one in three firefly species may be threatened with extinction and that some species might disappear before they are even discovered. Wingless firefly females — and sometimes larvae — are known as glow worms, while the flying beetles — usually male — are known as fireflies. Among the 173 known species of fireflies is a type of glow worm called the black ghost, found in British Columbia. It measures between five and seven millimetres but not much else is known about this creature, Fallon said.\n",

      "Article content “(Glow worms) are more cryptic animals,” she said. “(Black ghost) is data deficient. We don’t know anything about its habitat associations other than it’s been found in a forest along a river.” Fairweather said insect populations worldwide are declining, and fireflies are seeing a similar fate. What people don’t realize, they said, is the benefits that fireflies have for gardens and waterways. The fireflies that people see in their summer garden are the adults of the species with a lifespan of a few weeks; the bugs spend up to two years underground as larvae. “(Firefly) larvae are quite ferocious predators,” Fairweather said. “They’ll feed on worms and slugs and snails, and especially mosquito larvae in some ecosystems.”\n",

So it worries scientists when a warming planet dries out the earth and scorches forests, or when human activity fills swamps to create buildings _ the homes of these tiny animals are destroyed. In the village of Nanacamilpa, fireflies are helping save the towering pine and fir trees on the outskirts of Mexico City. Thousands of them light up a magical spectacle at dusk in the old-growth forests on reserves such as the Piedra Canteada park, about 75 kilometres east of the Mexican capital. Piedra Canteada in Tlaxcala state isn’t a government-run park, but a rural co-operative that has managed to emerge from poverty and dependence on logging with the help of the fireflies. For years, economic forces, including low prices for farm produce, forced rural communities like Piedra Canteada to cut down trees and sell the logs.\n",

Camp spaces are now sold out weeks in advance to families who come from all over the world. “Fireflies could be a huge source of ecotourism,” Fairweather said. “From May to June, within Canada, you can go out to most bogs or fields and see thousands of them. I think it’s just an incredible model that’s untapped.” Light pollution, Fallon said, is one of the biggest threats to firefly populations, especially since 75 per cent of these bugs are active at dusk or after dark. Fireflies use their light to find a mate, she said. Firefly species have various twinkling patterns: some emit fast bursts of flashing light, others have a burst of light and go dark; female glow worms, meanwhile, emit a soft shimmer while the male swoops in to find a mate, she said.\n",

There is a painful lack of baseline data on fireflies, Fallon said. “They’re so well known, there’s so much nostalgia around them . … But they’re kind of othered,” she said. “People just think of them as these magical creatures that light up the night. But then don’t connect it to the fact they’re part of our biodiversity.” Fairweather said funding for research into fireflies is hard to come by because of an “absence of thought.” “It’s ‘oh, this is just a staple from my childhood. It’s always going to be there,”‘ they said. “Who knows? Maybe in another 20 to 50 years, we won’t be able to show any examples of fireflies. We have these stories, but where are these organisms now?

      "\n",
      "Show Caption Hide Caption In jab at Trump, DeSantis touts support for Kim Reynolds Ron DeSantis takes a jab at former President Donald Trump, over his criticism of fellow governor Kim Reynolds, saying she has done a \"fantastic job.\" Donnelle Eller, Des Moines Register\n",
      "\n",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis is trimming his campaign staff after burning through nearly $8 million of his $20 million second quarter fundraising haul in the first few weeks of the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeSantis filed his second quarter fundraising report with the Federal Election Commission Saturday. It covers the period from the launch of his campaign on May 24 through June 30, and shows he had $12.2 million in cash on hand at the end of June, and $3 million of that only can be spent in the general election, not the primary.\n",
      "\n",
      "NBC News reported Saturday that DeSantis' campaign fired roughly a dozen staffers and more terminations are expected as it looks to trim costs. There are concerns that the campaign is spending money too quickly. There were 92 people on the campaign's payroll at some point in the second quarter, which NBC described as \"by far the most of any Republican presidential candidate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "DeSantis' fundraising report also shows he is relying heavily on larger donors. His campaign reported that $2.9 million of the $20 million came from donors who have given less than $200 to date, while the rest came from donors who gave $200 or more in aggregate.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeSantis' reliance on larger donors contrasts with former President Donald Trump, who has powered his campaign with an army of small donors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong small donor fundraising can be a sign of grassroots enthusiasm for a campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump currently leads DeSantis by 32 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of national GOP presidential primary polls.\n",
      "\n",
      "DeSantis announced on July 6 that he raised $20 million in the second quarter, but the FEC report filed Saturday provides detailed information on his donors. It is the first fundraising report filed by DeSantis' campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign reported $2.9 million in unitemized contributions from individual donors, and $16.9 million in itemized contributions. Presidential campaigns only are required to itemize contributions of $200 or greater, or when the aggregate of an individual's contributions tops $200.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Pat Fitzgerald’s 17-year run at his alma mater did not end well. The now former Northwestern football coach stumbled across the finish line, fired Monday in the wake of a sexualized hazing scandal inside the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprising? Yes, but probably shouldn’t be. The 48-year-old with the military haircut and old-school mentality joins the list of long-established coaches whose careers ended in controversy and chaos. Like them, Fitzgerald was so embedded into the football program that he became ingrown. When that happens, when a coach considers himself safely entrenched, and when staff and administration begin to worship him, well, can you say Joe Paterno? Or, closer to home, Woody Hayes. Jim Tressel. Urban Meyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the surface, Fitz’s fall from grace seems shocking. He famously fit the coach-as-father-figure narrative, caring for players as if they were his sons. The former Wildcats linebacker also filled the role of stand-up leader who did things the right way. But look closer and cracks appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching Fitzgerald’s career from start to finish, some say over the past five years he began to believe his own media guide bio; heavy on hype, light on accountability. As the years rolled along he began to think himself untouchable, perhaps even all-powerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirst for control without proper boundaries is nothing new for college football and basketball coaches, especially those established at one school for years. Their attitude too often becomes dismissive, as in “There is nothing to see here, because I said so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But stubborn pride and an overinflated ego that leads to lack of transparency are mere symptoms of the real issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason things go south for veteran coaches such as Fitzgerald has more to do with time than temperament. They stay too long. Or their school keeps them too long, which appears to be what happened at Northwestern. More time in charge meant Fitz wielded more power. And unbridled power typically ends in pain. For one and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeds of destruction are not automatically sown into every coach who has a statue outside the stadium. Over 16 seasons at Alabama, Nick Saban so far has avoided the kind of crippling scandal that topples legends. But the fuse is always waiting to be lit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The match strike at Northwestern was a whistleblower revealing allegations of sexually-oriented hazing that led to a six-month school investigation, which left enough unanswered questions that the student newspaper went “Hmmm” and began poking around. The poking led to prodding, which led to where we are today, with Fitzgerald fighting his dismissal on legal grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hazing could have been avoided. Wrong choices were made. Behavior was enabled. But again, those choices and enabling were impacted by the realities of time chipping away at good character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the coaching offices of Evanston, Illinois, two time-based formulas blended into fruition. One was Murphy’s Law, where anything that can go wrong, eventually will. The other was “infinite monkey theorem,” which posits that put monkey at a keyboard long enough and eventually just by chance it will type out the complete works of Shakespeare. Add a pinch of entropy, mixed with plenty of error in judgment, and there you have it: the longer a coach remains at the same place, the better chance some good but a lot of bad things will happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Dan Wolken: Pat Fitzgerald stood against unionization in college sports. It could have saved his job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paterno was fine until he wasn’t. After 45 seasons calling the shots at Penn State, JoePa got called on the phone and told he was being dismissed. The school’s board of trustees determined Paterno did not do enough to stop the sexual assault crimes of PSU assistant coach Jerry Sandusky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some think Paterno intentionally looked the other way – the old plausible deniability play – for fear his program would be burned to the ground if Sandusky’s crimes came to light. If true, shame on him. And of course “We Are” burned anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hayes won enough games over 28 seasons at Ohio State to tamp down criticism over his temper tantrums, until he went one punch too far. Tressel lied to the NCAA, putting his definition of protecting players/program ahead of NCAA bylaws. He was forced out after 10 seasons in Columbus. Given keys to the OSU kingdom, Meyer eventually locked himself out, done in by poor choices involving an assistant coach. He “retired” after seven seasons, then took his “I’m-in-charge” attitude to the NFL, where it dead-ended in disaster. NFL owners, unlike politically-motivated school presidents, don’t take kindly to being told to stay in their lanes.\n",
      "\n",
      "College coaches who feel the sting of dismissal like to blame everyone but themselves for the hatchet job that happened to their necks. Media was unfair. Administration was unsupportive. Fans were unrealistic. All of that is true sometimes. And some of it is true all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for coaches who spend a decade or more at the same school, the biggest enemy is longevity. The longer a coach remains at one place, the more he feels wanted. The more he feels wanted, the more he feels entitled. The more he feels entitled, the more he feels empowered. And the more he feels empowered, the more he covets total control, which corrupts.\n",
      "\n",
      "My solution? Term limits. Ten years at one school and it’s time to part company. An amicable split for both sides. A fresh start on both ends. This can’t become a rule, of course. More like sage advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a decade, both coach and school need a reset. The coach needs a new challenge. The school needs a re-energized coach not yet comfortable enough in his surroundings to demand complete control; one who is careful to play by other’s rules. A coach who understands what the great Paul Brown meant when he preached that everyone is important, but no one is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years is enough. Within 10 years, Woody won two national titles at Ohio State. Tress and Urban each collected one. Ryan Day would get six more seasons to get it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "More: Northwestern naming DC David Braun interim head coach after Pat Fitzgerald firing, per reports\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, recruiting becomes an issue. Hard to convince a kid to join your program when he knows you won’t be there a year or two from now. But at least this way he knows the deal up front. Plus, if it’s true what coaches preach, that recruiting decisions should be made based on school and program, not coach, then both school and program will be healthier by not having the same coach in place for more than a decade.\n",

      "A wildfire firefighter was killed while battling a blaze in the southwest corner of the Northwest Territories this weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was working near his home of Fort Liard, a 500-person hamlet about 40 kilometres north of the British Columbia border, when he was injured and died, according to the territory’s wildfire service. He and other crew members had been trying to prevent the 10-hectare fire from getting too close to Highway 7, the only direct road link between B.C. and the territory.\n",

      "\n",
      "The firefighter’s death is the second in Canada in the last week. On Thursday, 19-year-old Devyn Gale died while battling a fire near her hometown of Revelstoke, B.C., when a tree fell on her.

      "The Northwest Territories has seen 110 wildfires eat up 809,510 hectares of land so far this season, and 89 of them are still burning. By far the greatest burn area is in the Dehcho Region, where Fort Liard is located. In that region alone, 580,421 hectares have burned so far. Of the four wildfire stations in the region, two are classified at an “extreme” fire danger rating for Sunday and all four are forecast to be at “extreme” by Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This has already been a very challenging season,” Ms. Davey-Quantick told The Globe and Mail. She said they’ve had to evacuate four communities already, when in a typical season they would likely evacuate none. They’re also stretched particularly thin on resources because firefighters they would normally rely on from Alberta and elsewhere are busy with their own blazes.\n",

      "After a devastating start to Canada’s wildfire season left record-breaking wreckage in its wake, scientists are looking to artificial intelligence to play an important future role in detecting and fighting blazes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swaths of fires igniting from British Columbia to Nova Scotia temporarily displaced thousands of Canadians countrywide, spewed smog as far as Europe and burned through 3.3 million hectares of forest – equivalent to half the size of New Brunswick. All this despite the federal government shelling out approximately $1-billion a year to mitigate the blazes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts around the world have warned in recent years that the warming effects of climate change will lead to increasingly intense wildfire seasons and prolonged periods of smoke exposure in Canada. In February, 2022, the United Nations predicted fires will grow more destructive by the year and called wildfire risk reduction “more critical than ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These global alarm bells are leading experts to predict that Canada will have to increasingly tap into AI technologies in the form of drones, sensors and high-tech satellites to keep up with the fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Change is coming in terms of climate and technology,” said Joshua Johnson, forest fire research scientist with Natural Resources Canada (NRC). “I think that’s intimidating at times, but it’s forcing us to get creative.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada sees 100,000 square kilometres burned this record-breaking wildfire season\n",
      "\n",
      "OPINION: Canada’s wildfire approach needs to shift from reactive to proactive\n",
      "\n",
      "The current AI revolution, driven by the advent of powerful data-processing machines such as ChatGPT, has facilitated computing, customer service and many industries in between in recent months. It has enabled the creation of RADRFIRE, an American computing software that processes imaging data from a countrywide network of drones and satellites to detect, predict, evaluate and communicate early fires with fire stations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar technology, according to Mr. Johnson, could eventually help Canada make crucial decisions on how to allocate resources in peak fire season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we have 100 fires across the country and 30 crews, we need to determine where we most urgently have to focus our efforts – especially now that we have fires coast to coast,” he said. “AI will be a powerful tool for helping us make those calls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Johnson said his branch of government has recently been courted by a medley of startups, all offering their own AI-driven solutions to wildfires. SensaioTech, a Brazilian company also incorporated in Canada, uses localized, ground-bound sensors that monitor 14 variables – including humidity, soil temperature, salinity and pH levels – to provide minute-by-minute readings of an area’s probability of ignition.\n",
      "\n",
      "SensaioTech founder João Lopes says beta trials in Brazil suggest his creation can predict wildfires five days before they happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With satellites, you are seeing the present; it will not necessarily predict where fires could eventually ignite,” he said, adding that he expects prediction technology could eventually anticipate fires months in advance and allow for plenty of preparation time. Mr. Lopes hopes Canadian investors adopt his technology, though Canada’s size imposes an inherent challenge: Each sensor covers an area of five hectares of forest – a minuscule fraction of the country’s 362 million hectares, many of them situated north of the power grid and far beyond connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lopes is not alone in leveraging AI to create firefighting technology in recent years. The World Economic Forum developed FireAid: a live risk map meant to update fire information in real time and create better resource allocation. Similarly, American startup Pano AI uses computer vision to detect new wildfires quickly and accurately across five Western states and areas of Australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other companies focus instead on reducing unforced errors. Buzz Solutions, a California startup, uses machine learning to constantly inspect power-grid infrastructure for defects – such as insulation damage and overheating – to detect spark risks. In 2021, the company test-ran its technology in Newfoundland and reported faster remediation of power lines after storms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve seen a greater appetite for our product every year as the climate changes, grids age and our cities encroach on vegetation – all risk factors for spark-induced fires,” said Kaitlyn Albertoli, chief executive officer of Buzz Solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike Flannigan, British Columbia Research Chair in predictive services, emergency management and fire science, is wary of thinking about machine learning and emerging technologies as the only answer to the country’s wildfire struggles. He said a simpler, more immediate way to affect change is by modifying our own behaviour, because half of the country’s fires are human-caused. For example, implementing more forest closings – restrictions on activities in the woods when an area is susceptible to burning – would be a good start.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We should look at AI and machine learning as another tool in the tool kit, not a panacea that will solve all of our problems,” Prof. Flannigan said. “We’re just not there yet: You would need thousands of drones to replicate the impact of just one water bomber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet he is bullish on AI tools that could better predict the location of extreme fire weather and cut the time it takes to react to it. Current prediction and modelling technology, Prof. Flannigan said, can delay firefighting efforts by up to three days, providing ample time for the blazes to rapidly spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Johnson, meanwhile, sees value in the prospect of AI-driven sensor technologies, as they could especially come in handy for round-the-clock monitoring of tourist areas such as Banff and Jasper. He said he trusts that NRC will bolster its firefighting technology in coming years, and be prepared if fires ever threaten those high-traffic areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the Canadian government plans to launch its RADRFIRE equivalent in 2029: WildfireSat, a $170-million satellite meant to use thermal imaging to deliver vital information to fire stations twice daily to facilitate decision making. But until then, Mr. Johnson said, he sees value in entertaining emerging tech that could minimize fire damage coast to coast, wherever it comes from.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I firmly believe that in the past 10 years we’ve made some good steps in the right direction,” he said. “Moving forward, there will be times when it will feel like the climate is moving faster than we are, but I think we are on the right track.”\n"

      "Article content Today’s media landscape is marked by an audacious deception, fueled by an agenda to skew public opinion and subtly undermine the foundational principles that undergird our nation. Regrettably, and perhaps unsurprisingly, this often finds its mark. This taps into a flaw in our brains, one that favors apparent experts and short, easily digestible sound bites over complex, lengthy legal dissertations. After all, even if the populace were inclined to pore over these dense 40-plus-page opinions, can we realistically expect millions to grasp the nuanced labyrinth of legal precedent, or even the bare-bone fundamentals of the legal process and the Constitution? It’s challenging as is for lawyers who have spent their careers studying these topics to understand them, so how could anybody else do so — or even find the time to do so? It is this inherent impossibility that the media capitalizes on to mislead the public.\n",

      "Article content Take for instance the 303 Creative case, which posited that the government cannot compel a business engaging in expressive activity — in this case, website design — to produce speech that contradicts its principles. This reaffirms a century-old First Amendment tenet — the government cannot coerce speech. We’re not talking about a person selling doughnuts or toys, we’re talking about speech. But you’ll be hard-pressed to find liberal pundits commending the Supreme Court for safeguarding people from the slippery slope of government-compelled speech. Instead, you’ll encounter them levying outrageous claims, asserting the Supreme Court has given discrimination its legal seal of approval. Sadly, even the vice-president of the United States put out a misleading statement, saying, “When you walk into a restaurant, hotel, or any business open to the public, you are entitled to be served free from discrimination.” This misunderstands the cases holding entirely, and ensures that there is more fodder for media outlets and influences to peddle the misinformation that it is now open season for discrimination.\n",

      "Article content Would a Democrat endorse being obligated to produce art featuring a Confederate flag for a Southern wedding? Consider, too, the affirmative action case that questioned whether there was a compelling justification for discrimination in college admissions. The Supreme Court’s decision to strike down affirmative action was firmly rooted in historical precedents, citing clearly past cases where justices from both ends of the ideological spectrum plainly stated that discrimination in college admissions is “dangerous,” but ultimately allowing it temporarily — and only temporarily. The media, nonetheless, constructed a narrative framing the decision as an affront to Black people and all those who have been burdened by racism. The reports became all about what the decision will do, but not why the decision was made. The media took pains to not state legitimate alternatives like using a person’s actual hardships in determining whether they should get a boost. The Court made one of the most powerful arguments against affirmative action ever made public, yet it was entirely overlooked.\n",

Misleadingly, the media linked the policy arguments of Republicans to the Supreme Court’s ruling, despite the fact that these arguments were not featured in the case. The media consistently omitted the ruling’s rationale, the significance of the tripartite branches of government, and how Congress should operate when an agency lacks statutory authority. They missed the primary reasoning: that the phrases “modify or waive” did not equate to “completely rewrite,” as the Court stated.

These complex narratives shouldn’t be discarded or simplified to a pithy one-liner; they are worthy of far more.

      "['Andrea Woo', 'Joy Spearchief-Morris'] 2023-07-17 22:18:05-04:00 Open this photo in gallery: In British Columbia, there were 373 active wildfires on Monday, with 110 considered out of control, according to an information officer with the BC Wildfire Service.Jesse Winter/The Globe and Mail\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 900 wildfires continued to burn across Canada on Monday, as military assistance arrived in British Columbia and plumes of smoke triggered air quality warnings in more than a dozen U.S. states.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blazes have doubled in number since mid-June, and several provinces and territories have recently set new record-high temperatures, causing experts to worry that the hot and dry conditions will accelerate the burning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In B.C., there were 373 active wildfires on Monday, with 110 considered out of control, according to Sarah Budd, an information officer with the BC Wildfire Service. Of those, 23 were considered fires of note, meaning they were highly visible or had the potential to impact people, communities or critical infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Budd said forests in the province’s northern half have sustained repeated lightning strikes over the past 15 days, which have fed the flames. She added that the province’s hotspots are expecting a brief reprieve over the next few days, but that fire conditions could pick up again later in the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve got some high winds moving through and we’ll see a little more precipitation, but after that, it’ll start to clear, we’ll get some sun and warming, and that will feed the fires that are currently on the landscape,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reconnaissance team with the Canadian Armed Forces arrived in Prince George, B.C., and on Monday worked with the BC Wildfire Service to co-ordinate firefighting deployment details. One unit of soldiers will likely deploy to the Burns Lake area, at the Northwest Fire Centre, and another to Vanderhoof, at the Prince George Fire Centre, the CAF said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CAF are also providing two CH-146 Griffon helicopters and, if needed, a CC-130J Hercules plane from the Royal Canadian Air Force. The aircraft will support mobility and logistical tasks, as well as emergency evacuations, the CAF said.\n",
      "\n",
      "B.C.’s coroner issued a public safety bulletin on Monday after confirming that a nine-year-old boy from 100 Mile House, in the province’s interior, had died from a medical condition aggravated by wildfire smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy, Carter Vigh, died last Tuesday in an emergency room, according to his mother, Amber Vigh. A B.C. government statement said he had suffered a severe asthma attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quebec’s provincial forest fire control agency, the Société de protection des forêts contre le feu (SOPFEU), said on its website that there were 102 active fires in the province on Monday. It added that 507 fires have burned 1.5 million hectares this year in what the agency calls the “intensive protective zone,” which covers the province’s southern half. That is 96 times the 10-year average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 102 active fires, 79 were in the “northern zone,” which covers less populated areas in the province’s northern half. A total of 126 fires have burned 2.8 million hectares in the northern zone this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOPFEU is responsible for extinguishing fires in the intensive zone. Fires in the northern zone are dealt with only when they threaten communities or strategic infrastructure, Stéphane Caron, SOPFEU’s prevention and communications co-ordinator, said in an e-mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ontario, 69 fires were burning on Monday. According to the province’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry there have been 445 wildfires in Ontario so far this year, surpassing last year’s 127 and the 10-year average of 378.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year’s fires have already burned more than 392,000 hectares of land in the province. Last year, only 2,401 hectares burned, and the 10-year average is just over 149,000 hectares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jesse Wagar, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said regions across the country have broken several all-time maximum temperature records (the hottest temperatures ever reached in history) and daily maximum temperature records (the hottest for a particular day) so far this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout May, different locations in Alberta broke 226 local daily temperature records, and locations in Saskatchewan broke 53. Neither province broke any daily temperature records in May, 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 8, Norman Wells and Fort Good Hope, in the Northwest Territories, both broke all-time temperature records, at 37.9 and 37.4 degrees, respectively. These two temperature readings are the fourth and fifth hottest ever recorded in the territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the top five temperatures in the territory, four occurred in the past eight years and three during the past three summers, a trend Ms. Wagar said is alarming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This rate of warming and this level of heat, particularly how early it started in May – it’s unheard of. This is very, very hot,” she said. She noted that scorching weather across the country could make for “tenuous” wildfire conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two people have died battling Canada’s wildfires in the past week. On Thursday, BC Wildfire Service firefighter Devyn Gale, 19, was clearing brush in a remote area near Revelstoke when she was struck by a falling tree. Team members located Ms. Gale, a third-year nursing student at the University of British Columbia’s Okanagan campus, after losing radio contact with her. She was airlifted to Queen Victoria Hospital, where she died of her injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her brother, Nolan Gale, wrote in an Instagram post that she “had the best head on her shoulders” of the family’s three siblings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was careful, considerate, hardworking,” he wrote. “She was smarter and better at what she did than she gave herself credit for. I’m so grateful to have grown up beside her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lesley Cormack, principal and deputy vice-chancellor of UBC’s Okanagan campus, said the fact that Ms. Gale was on the front line fighting wildfires while working toward a nursing career “speaks to the strength of her character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, a firefighter in the Northwest Territories died from an injury sustained in the Fort Liard district. The territory’s government has not released the name of the firefighter, but has said he is from Fort Liard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the more than a dozen U.S. states where smoke from Canada’s wildfires has triggered air quality alerts are New York, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Montana.\n",
      "\n",
      "New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the smoke is expected to cause the Air Quality Index in upstate communities to reach levels that are considered “unhealthy for all,” and that the state would be issuing hundreds of thousands of N95-style masks.\n"

      "\n",
      "There are more than 880 wildfires currently burning across Canada, with more than 575 deemed out of control. Most of the fires are in Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. More than 10 million hectares of land has been scorched – the worst in the country’s recorded history – with months of wildfire season still left.\n",

      "\n",
      "Air quality health index across Canada\n",
      "\n",
      "The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is a scale from 1 to 10+ that provides an indicator of the health risk related to air quality and can be found on the Environment Canada website or provincial environment ministry sites. Canada’s WeatherCAN app can send alerts about what to do when the air quality is poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are growing concerns about how to grapple with the long-term health impact of worsening air quality. Experts advise higher-risk individuals to take immediate steps to protect themselves when the risk level of the AQHI increases. According to the index, levels of 4 to 6 are considered moderate risk and vulnerable individuals are urged to reduce or reschedule outdoor activities. Levels of 7 to 10 are considered high risk, and anything above 10 is considered very high risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staying inside with doors and windows closed and using an air filter can reduce inhalation of fine particulate matter. If no air filter is available, an air conditioner can also be used to reduce some of the fine particles in the air. If people have to spend time outside, such as those who work outdoors, high-quality masks can help.\n"

Because for many voters, the cure will just feel like more of the disease. Inflation, the ghastly economic ill that Pierre Poilievre has blamed on the government since before he became Conservative Leader, is easing off to levels closer to the historical norm. But the Bank of Canada’s campaign to fight what it insists is stubborn core inflation with higher interest rates – the quarter-point rise last week was the 10th hike in 16 months – is a big challenge to household finances. For many, it will feel like more inflation, but worse.”\n",

And it’s looking more and more like we’re not. It goes beyond the affordable-housing crunch and whether everyone will have access to primary health care. Now, some of the Calgary agencies that help people get settled in the country say uncertainty about funding from the federal government is leading to long waiting lists and layoffs.”\n",

      "['Katie Strang', 'The Athletic Staff'] 2023-07-18 00:00:00 The University of Vermont fired men’s hockey coach Todd Woodcroft on Tuesday after an investigation into “inappropriate” communications with a student at the school. The conduct being investigated involved “inappropriate text messages with a UVM student on multiple occasions that failed to maintain professional boundaries,” according to UVM athletics director Jeff Schulman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“The University of Vermont Athletic Department has high expectations for the conduct of our coaches and all involved with our department,” Schulman said in a statement. “After reviewing the findings of an investigation conducted by UVM’s Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity that was completed this week, it is clear that Coach Woodcroft failed to meet those expectations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not immediately clear when the investigation concluded. The Athletic asked Woodcroft on July 7 whether he was under investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, that is not accurate,” he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Athletic emailed UVM on the same day asking whether Woodcroft was placed on leave. On July 10, in response to that email, a UVM spokesperson declined to comment, citing “standing practice to not comment on personnel matters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Later Tuesday, Woodcroft’s attorney, Andrew Miltenberg, released a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We vehemently disagree with the process and the findings of a proceeding that lacked fundamental fairness and due process,” Miltenberg told The Athletic. “We strongly believe the University’s decision was contrary to the facts and the law. We intend to pursue justice for Mr. Woodcroft, who has been an outstanding coach and community advocate for over two decades.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Woodcroft became the coach of Vermont on April 15, 2020. Prior to Vermont, Woodcroft was an assistant coach for four seasons with the Winnipeg Jets. He also spent three seasons as a scouting director and professional scout with the Calgary Flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steve Wiedler will be Vermont’s interim coach for the 2023-24 season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The team and I have tremendous confidence in Coach Wiedler’s ability to successfully lead our program,” Schulman said. “He has played a major role in the recruitment and development of our current players and will step into this important role with the full support of our team and his Athletic Department colleagues.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Show Caption Hide Caption Allworth Advice: Retirement Savings Amy Wagner with Allworth Financial discusses retirement savings. Allworth Financial, Cincinnati Enquirer\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin Rucker had one joyful moment in the spotlight back in 2013, just as the city of Detroit wrangled through its painful municipal bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire engine operator with the magnificent, booming baritone won a \"Home of the Brave National Anthem Singing Contest\" at Comerica Park, home of the Tigers baseball team. The $10,000 prize was used for a number of things to help fellow firefighters, contributing to a department school supply drive, and to other projects, including paying for a microwave, at other firehouses in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That money kind of went everywhere,\" Rucker said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His fellow firefighters fondly remember Rucker as the \"fireman crooner.\" He has sung the national anthem at major Detroit stadiums and venues for many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rucker worked in the Detroit Fire Department for 23 years and would have worked longer to get a full pension. But he had to retire in September 2022 at the mandatory age of 60. He, like others still on the job in 2013, felt the hit of the city's bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many are now new retirees facing financial challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rucker's pension payout was a mix of old and new — calculated based on benefits accrued under the legacy plan, which was in place before the bankruptcy, and the hybrid plan, which took over after the bankruptcy and pays less to those who retired later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the legacy plan, Rucker's pension benefit was frozen and the calculation was based on a 10% pay cut that hit many in the police and fire department in September 2013, a pay cut that was put in place to address the city's financial distress. Rucker's benefits under the legacy plan did not accrue any cost of living adjustments or salary increases in the future because that plan was frozen, according to Jeffrey Pegg, a firefighter and secretary of the Detroit Fire Fighters Association Local 344. Pegg also is a trustee for the police and fire pension board.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hybrid pension plan took effect on July 1, 2014, and uses a smaller multiplier in the calculations, Pegg said, and leads to a smaller pension benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now 10 years after Detroit filed for bankruptcy, Rucker is happy to have found a job after he retired that pays $15 an hour as an express driver, delivering auto parts from a Ford dealership in Dearborn, Michigan, to mechanics all over town. He has worked there since March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Retirement was the greatest seven-month vacation I've ever had. In fact, it was the only seven-month vacation I've ever had,\" joked Rucker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new 40-hour-a-week job is definitely necessary, he said, to pay his mortgage and cover his expenses. His savings, he admits, were limited to about $100,000. While that might sound like a lot to some, he notes, it can be gone in four years or so if you start withdrawing $4,000 a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it last longer, he figures, he might be able to tap into $400 a month or so — or $4,800 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't have nearly enough money to keep me going to, I'm guessing age 85, which I'm hoping to live to. No one knows what their expiration date is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His pension is about $24,000 a year — or $2,000 a month. He also draws $1,000 a month or so right now from his limited savings in a deferred income plan. \"I'm literally eating up the principal every month,\" he said. \"It's not a rosy picture.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What's ahead for Social Security? Estimate of cost of living adjustment rose for 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows a paycheck, even a small one, can help cover some bills and delay draining his savings too early in the game. He says he appreciates what he has but he knew that he had to find another job after leaving the fire department.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not like your savings replenish themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rucker slashed one bill this year because he has been able to obtain health care through his new job. He's now paying about $200 a month for health care, instead of paying about $527 a month for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. He had been avoiding going to the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's looking at one tax break for his Michigan income taxes in 2023, too. A new state law exempts pension income from the Michigan state income tax beginning in 2023 for public police officers and firefighters, county correction officers, and state troopers and sergeants. For all taxpayers, the Michigan income tax rate has dropped to 4.05% in 2023, down from 4.25% in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Left up to me, I'd still be working,\" he said. \"My exit was mandatory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rucker bought a new home with a brand new mortgage in October 2021, about a year before he retired. He had lived in Rosedale Park in Detroit since 1996, which he loved for many years. His neighbors had his keys to his house and vice versa; they looked out for one another when on vacation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He decided to leave his old home after he became very disturbed about some murders that happened on his attractive street of big brick homes and well-maintained lawns. One robbery and murder bothers him to this day, where 29-year-old Detroit firefighter Jack Wiley Jr. was found shot in his home in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was very, very sad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After that case and other troubling incidents, he felt like the specialness of his neighborhood was gone. He prayed over it but then felt it was time to move, \"get out of here, go someplace else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the end of my career, I took on a brand new mortgage,\" he said. He went from nothing a month to a mortgage of $1,200. And then there was a property tax increase that hit after the taxable value went up, which bumped the payment up to $1,500 after he retired. He knew he needed another job to keep up. His wife is working in retail sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't take another increase in anything,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rucker joined the fire department later in his life in 1999 after working at Lear Seating in Detroit, making about $45,000 a year. But he began worrying about the future of the auto industry, which seemed to have constant ups and downs and a fair share of layoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looked like dark days ahead at the plant,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city's fire department had a hiring campaign and he felt that it was the right move, even though he'd start at about $25,000 a year. The idea was to build toward the future and he eventually did make more than $85,000 a year for several years. He was making six figures the last few years with overtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt like the city's workers and retirees, including firefighters, took on too much of a financial burden to bail out the city's from its debts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Detroit was not bankrupt,\" Rucker maintains to this day, 10 years after the bankruptcy filing. \"It was a money grab.\"\n",

      "['Katie Strang', 'The Athletic Staff'] 2023-07-18 00:00:00 The University of Vermont fired men’s hockey coach Todd Woodcroft on Tuesday after an investigation into “inappropriate” communications with a student at the school. The conduct being investigated involved “inappropriate text messages with a UVM student on multiple occasions that failed to maintain professional boundaries,” according to UVM athletics director Jeff Schulman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“The University of Vermont Athletic Department has high expectations for the conduct of our coaches and all involved with our department,” Schulman said in a statement. “After reviewing the findings of an investigation conducted by UVM’s Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity that was completed this week, it is clear that Coach Woodcroft failed to meet those expectations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A UVM spokesperson told The Athletic on Wednesday that a report was first filed with the university regarding Woodcroft’s conduct on March 16 and that he was not placed on leave during the investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“(Woodcroft) was asked to have no contact with the individuals who made the report or participated as witnesses in the investigation and to work from home until the matter was resolved,” the spokesperson said. “He honored these requests without any issues.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not immediately clear when the investigation concluded. The Athletic asked Woodcroft on July 7 whether he was under investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, that is not accurate,” he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later Tuesday, Woodcroft’s attorney, Andrew Miltenberg, released a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We vehemently disagree with the process and the findings of a proceeding that lacked fundamental fairness and due process,” Miltenberg told The Athletic. “We strongly believe the University’s decision was contrary to the facts and the law. We intend to pursue justice for Mr. Woodcroft, who has been an outstanding coach and community advocate for over two decades.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Woodcroft attended Florida Panthers development camp last week in a guest coaching capacity and did not appear to disclose any details of that probe to the NHL club. A Panthers spokesperson told The Athletic on Tuesday when news of his firing was made public that it was the first time the team learned of the investigation into Woodcroft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Woodcroft became the coach of Vermont on April 15, 2020. Prior to Vermont, Woodcroft was an assistant coach for four seasons with the Winnipeg Jets. He also spent three seasons as a scouting director and professional scout with the Calgary Flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steve Wiedler will be Vermont’s interim coach for the 2023-24 season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The team and I have tremendous confidence in Coach Wiedler’s ability to successfully lead our program,” Schulman said. “He has played a major role in the recruitment and development of our current players and will step into this important role with the full support of our team and his Athletic Department colleagues.”\n",

      "They are drawn together by a sense of duty and comradeship.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the risks they face were brought home last week by the death in British Columbia of Devyn Gale, a nursing student. Aged just 19, Ms. Gale was already in her third summer as a wildland firefighter when she was crushed by a falling tree as her team battled an out-of-control blaze near her hometown of Revelstoke in the southern Interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Lange is undergoing firefighting training at Lakeland College in Vermilion, central Alberta, but has already seen action battling blazes in the province this summer. She said Ms. Gale’s death was “devastating” but only made her more determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel like it makes me want to be a firefighter more and kind of learn more so that I can protect myself and my teammates,” said Ms. Lange, who is originally from Manitoba.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the tragedy had bonded her class of 31 student firefighters, underscoring their shared goals of saving lives and watching each other’s backs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BC Wildfire Service said in a statement that it employs about 1,600 seasonal personnel each year, and about a third are postsecondary students working during their summer vacation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As our core wildfire season happens at a time when many students have their summer break, they are often looking for work at that time. As such, 30 to 35 per cent of them would normally be expected to return to school in the fall,” said the statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs, said “a great deal of students” are involved in wildland firefighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildland firefighters are often hired for one pay season, typically between the end of May and mid-September. He said that in summer months, the number of paid wildland firefighters spikes compared to volunteer firefighters.\n",

      "“We don’t see a big increase of volunteerism for those four months that students are back at home, away from school,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do see an increase of wildland firefighters, because it’s a pay opportunity, whereas volunteering in your communities is not a pay opportunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The starting hourly wage for firefighters in B.C. ranges from $26 to $30 per hour with more for overtime and standby hours.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ms. Lange’s classmate Mark Uwazny, 21, said he decided to become a firefighter in Grade 9 after he was involved in the rescue of a fellow Boy Scout who had gone into thermal shock during a winter survival challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“[It was] the way that we just kind of all came together as a community to make sure that this one person got everything that they needed in a timely fashion,” said Ms. Uwazny, who is from Lethbridge, Alberta.\n",

      "Mr. Uwazny said his family was “happy and excited” when he decided to become a firefighter through Lakeland’s training course.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May, Mr. Uwazny and Ms. Lange spent five or six evenings fighting wildfires that burned about 62 square kilometres in Parkland County, west of Edmonton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing a wildfire up close for the first time was an “unreal and crazy” experience, said Ms. Lange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already they feel like they are part of the firefighting community, and Mr. Uwazny said the loss of Ms. Gale felt like “losing a family member.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In our class, there are 31 of us … [it’s] something that could happen to one of us and there goes your family,” Mr. Uwazny said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the other part of being in a family is the strength of the bonds, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some young firefighters only last a few seasons. Jennifer Seguin lasted nine, on and off.\n",
      "\n",
      "She joined the BC Wildfire Service in summer 2005, when she was on break from studying social work at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Ms. Gale, she was 19 at the time. She said news of Ms. Gale’s death left her in “shock and complete devastation,” as Ms. Gale’s circumstances resonated with her own former life. Ms. Seguin now works in health care in Manitoba.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Devyn’s passing is such a tragedy as she was one of many young people doing this job … she was headed in a direction where she was going to give back to the community as a nurse and help other people along their health journey,” said Ms. Seguin, her voice trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said firefighting was a tough job of sacrifice, sometimes involving 16-hour days in remote locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Seguin recalled a “scary” encounter in 2017 when her crew faced a fire in Princeton, B.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were one of the first crews on scene and the conditions were very dry, very hot. The wind was blowing … and it was an intensity that required we pulled away from the fire,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had to get close to understand what the nature of it was. And when we knew that there wasn’t anything we could do with the resources we had … we pulled back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the extreme conditions, the job also meant missing out on traditional summer activities, or major life events like a friend’s wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was an experience Ms. Seguin said she “wouldn’t trade for anything.”\n",

      "When Reese Lange was in kindergarten, she dreamed of joining the police. But it was in high school that she decided on her true calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 21-year-old is now part of an army of young men and women, many of them college students, who are spending their summer battling what could be one of Canada’s worst fire seasons on record.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are drawn together by a sense of duty and comradeship.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the risks they face were brought home last week by the death in British Columbia of Devyn Gale, a nursing student. Aged just 19, Ms. Gale was already in her third summer as a wildland firefighter when she was crushed by a falling tree as her team battled an out-of-control blaze near her hometown of Revelstoke in the southern Interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Lange is undergoing firefighting training at Lakeland College in Vermilion, central Alberta, but has already seen action battling blazes in the province this summer. She said Ms. Gale’s death was “devastating” but only made her more determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel like it makes me want to be a firefighter more and kind of learn more so that I can protect myself and my teammates,” said Ms. Lange, who is originally from Manitoba.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the tragedy had bonded her class of 31 student firefighters, underscoring their shared goals of saving lives and watching each other’s backs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BC Wildfire Service said in a statement that it employs about 1,600 seasonal personnel each year, and about a third are postsecondary students working during their summer vacation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As our core wildfire season happens at a time when many students have their summer break, they are often looking for work at that time. As such, 30 to 35 per cent of them would normally be expected to return to school in the fall,” said the statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs, said “a great deal of students” are involved in wildland firefighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildland firefighters are often hired for one pay season, typically between the end of May and mid-September. He said that in summer months, the number of paid wildland firefighters spikes compared to volunteer firefighters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t see a big increase of volunteerism for those four months that students are back at home, away from school,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do see an increase of wildland firefighters, because it’s a pay opportunity, whereas volunteering in your communities is not a pay opportunity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The starting hourly wage for firefighters in B.C. ranges from $26 to $30 per hour with more for overtime and standby hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for some young firefighters, it’s not just about the pay. It’s a calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Lange’s classmate Mark Uwazny, 21, said he decided to become a firefighter in Grade 9 after he was involved in the rescue of a fellow Boy Scout who had gone into thermal shock during a winter survival challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“[It was] the way that we just kind of all came together as a community to make sure that this one person got everything that they needed in a timely fashion,” said Ms. Uwazny, who is from Lethbridge, Alberta.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that moment on, his family expected him to work in the emergency services.\n",

      "Wildfire maps 2023: Tracking fires and air quality across Canada\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Uwazny said his family was “happy and excited” when he decided to become a firefighter through Lakeland’s training course.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May, Mr. Uwazny and Ms. Lange spent five or six evenings fighting wildfires that burned about 62 square kilometres in Parkland County, west of Edmonton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing a wildfire up close for the first time was an “unreal and crazy” experience, said Ms. Lange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already they feel like they are part of the firefighting community, and Mr. Uwazny said the loss of Ms. Gale felt like “losing a family member.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In our class, there are 31 of us … [it’s] something that could happen to one of us and there goes your family,” Mr. Uwazny said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the other part of being in a family is the strength of the bonds, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some young firefighters only last a few seasons. Jennifer Seguin lasted nine, on and off.\n",
      "\n",
      "She joined the BC Wildfire Service in summer 2005, when she was on break from studying social work at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Ms. Gale, she was 19 at the time. She said news of Ms. Gale’s death left her in “shock and complete devastation,” as Ms. Gale’s circumstances resonated with her own former life. Ms. Seguin now works in health care in Manitoba.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Devyn’s passing is such a tragedy as she was one of many young people doing this job … she was headed in a direction where she was going to give back to the community as a nurse and help other people along their health journey,” said Ms. Seguin, her voice trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said firefighting was a tough job of sacrifice, sometimes involving 16-hour days in remote locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Seguin recalled a “scary” encounter in 2017 when her crew faced a fire in Princeton, B.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were one of the first crews on scene and the conditions were very dry, very hot. The wind was blowing … and it was an intensity that required we pulled away from the fire,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had to get close to understand what the nature of it was. And when we knew that there wasn’t anything we could do with the resources we had … we pulled back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the extreme conditions, the job also meant missing out on traditional summer activities, or major life events like a friend’s wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was an experience Ms. Seguin said she “wouldn’t trade for anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am very grateful and privileged that I had the opportunity and that I was able to participate,” she said.\n"

      "Two children were among five people travelling in West Hants, N.S., when their vehicle was submerged, RCMP spokesperson Cindy Bayers said in an e-mail, adding that the three other occupants managed to escape.\n",

      "The RCMP said searches for the missing were underway, but they urged the public to stay home and not join the search “as current conditions are dangerous.” They said there were no other reports of missing or injured people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list of infrastructure damage from the flooding is “long and it will continue to grow,” said Premier Tim Houston during a news conference Saturday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We got three months’ worth of rain in less than 24 hours. It came fast, and it came furious,” Mr. Houston said. “Our climate is changing, it’s obvious around us.”\n",

      "Emergency shelters were opened for evacuees throughout the affected areas.\n",

      "Officials said some places received between 200 and 300 mm of rain since Friday afternoon. Ian Hubbard, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said Halifax normally gets around 95 mm of rain for the entire month of July. What fell since Friday represents “a tremendous amount of water coming down in a very short period of time,” he said, in a province that already experienced a very wet month contrasting with the hot and dry weather that exacerbated major wildfires in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some areas could expect an additional 40 to 100 mm, Environment Canada said in an online advisory Saturday. “The tropical nature of the rainfall from this system has already significantly impacted parts of the province,” the agency said, and the ground, “already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.” Heavy precipitation was also expected on Prince Edward Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nova Scotia Public Works Minister Kim Masland said in a statement that a full assessment of the damage to provincial infrastructure would have to wait until the flood waters recede. She warned it would take time to reopen roads – several of which were closed starting Friday afternoon around Halifax – and make repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Halifax District RCMP advised motorists to stay home due to bad weather and said there have been multiple reports of local flooding on Hammonds Plains Road, Lucasville Road, Sackville Cross Road, and parts of Sackville Drive and Beaverbank Road.\n",

      "Climate hazards, including heavy rainfalls and flooding causing billions of dollars in damages, have intensified across North America. They are projected to continue to do so as the planet gets warmer, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body of hundreds of climate scientists. The same is true of heatwaves and wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, more than 440 active wildfires were burning across B.C. Saturday – nearly half of the country’s total – including 270 deemed out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Intense heat seemed to worsen the situation, with 68 new blazes erupting Saturday. There were 87 active evacuation orders and alerts affecting municipalities, regional districts, and First Nations throughout the province Saturday, according to B.C.’s online emergency map.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the province’s south, including the Okanagan Valley, the South Thompson, and the southern Fraser Canyon, faced unseasonably hot temperatures with highs near 35 degrees Celsius, triggering heat warnings from Environment Canada.\n",

Archeologists aren’t always called in to survey burn areas in Canada and each time they aren’t, they lose the opportunity to discover slivers of the past.

      "In April of 2018, the team of archeologists called in after the Kenow wildfire in Waterton, Alta., were relieved to see the landscape hadn’t shifted too much since it was torched some seven months earlier. The blackened ground was scattered with old trash from the 1930s and 40s, trade beads and tobacco tins from the early days of colonization, and stone arrowheads, tools and bison bones from First Nations groups long before that.\n",

      "Alanna Shockley, one of the team’s field technicians, said if there had been a significant snowmelt that spring, many of those artifacts could have been lost.\n",

      "Rainfall, snow and meltwater can easily shift charred earth and transport artifacts far from their original resting spot. Without trees and other vegetation to structure the ground, slopes are prone to landslides, and creek or riverbanks – where settlements were especially common – are susceptible to collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once those artifacts are moved, then their context is gone,” Ms. Shockley said. It’s only by examining an item in relation to its environment that archeologists can ask the right questions and begin to piece together a narrative, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "An arrowhead found washed down a river on its own may not mean much, but a bunch of them found near stone flakes, tools and the remnants of hearths could indicate a hunting camp, among other things, Ms. Shockley said. She said stumbling upon a scene like that can feel like being transported back in time. She no longer works in archeology but maintains a love for it.\n",

      "Relics of Indigenous culture are the most at risk of wildfire damage. Rock art, either painted onto or carved into stone, can easily break off when its surface undergoes sudden heating and cooling. And trees that hold the history of Indigenous people’s sustainable harvesting practices can be destroyed.\n",
      "\n",

      "It’s not just fires themselves that pose a threat to artifacts, it’s the actions taken to battle them. Dozers used to dig fireguards, water from airtankers and hoses, and chemical suppressants can all damage and displace artifacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian Leslie, a former helitack wildfire fighter and current general manager at Ember Archaeology, said he’d like to see more collaboration between government ministries to protect areas with a high potential for archeological significance during wildfire-fighting efforts. Having an archeologist on hand to provide some guidance on, for example, where fireguards may be more or less disruptive could make a big difference, Mr. Leslie said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He and other archeologists believe governments should make post-impact analyses a requirement after wildfires, such as was done in Waterton. In the United States, the Bureau of Land Management mandates that the impact of wildfires on archeological resources be determined as part of an assessment process, followed by a response plan implemented within five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, each province and territory determine how to protect archeological sites, with patchwork results.\n",
      "\n",
      "B.C., for instance, which faces some of the worst wildfire seasons in the country, doesn’t require postimpact analyses, but does conduct assessments when firefighting activities are believed to have affected sensitive sites. It also mandates archeology training for heavy-equipment operators and recommends it for the rest of wildfire staff, and, at times, connects with First Nations directly about how to navigate sensitive areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberta, which has the highest average number of wildfires out of all the provinces, does not require postimpact assessments. Its wildfire service says they consider cultural sites when developing their management plans.\n",

      "Mr. Leslie said he’d like to see provinces explore more innovative options, including using laser-scanning technologies such as LiDAR, to remotely map out the characteristics of high-priority archeology sites, but added that he realizes protecting history isn’t always top of mind.\n",

      "A large blaze burning on the Greek island of Rhodes for the fifth day has forced authorities to order an evacuation of four locations, including two seaside resorts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In previous days, the wildfire was confined to the island’s mountainous centre, but aided by winds, very high temperatures and dry conditions, it spread Saturday toward the coast on the island’s central-eastern side. Local media reported the fires had reached three hotels, whose clients had already been evacuated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire department spokesman Yannis Artopios said Saturday afternoon that the residents of four localities were sent SMS messages to evacuate – in two localities they were told to move to the northeast and, in two others, to the southwest.\n",

      "Artopios said that more than 200 firefighters and 40 fire engines were operating on the ground, assisted by three planes and five helicopters. The force includes 31 firefighters from Slovakia, with five fire engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main front of the fire is a triangle, with two of its points near the sea and one in the mountains. On maps, each side of the triangle appears more than 10 kilometres (six miles) long.\n",

      "Three coast guard vessels, plus one from the army, were evacuating people from two beaches. Twenty private boats were assisting and the Greek navy was sending a vessel.\n",

      "\n",
      "The fire northwest of Athens and one near Sparta were subsiding, he said, although the conditions, including temperatures set to reach 45 C (113 F) on Sunday and low humidity (below 15%), mean that the danger is not over and more wildfires might break out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire department has designated almost the whole eastern part of the mainland, plus the islands of Evia and Rhodes as well as large swaths of the southwest, as Category 5, the highest for the risk of fire outbreaks Sunday. A further good chunk of the country has been designated Category 4, very high risk.\n",

      "Local police said 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels. Six people were briefly treated at a hospital for respiratory problems. A person who fell and broke a leg during a hotel evacuation and a pregnant woman remained hospitalized, the latter in good condition, authorities said.\n",

      "\n",
      "“There were lots of people in Gennadi sent from the hotels — many in just swimsuits having been told to leave everything in the hotel,” he told PA. “As night fell, we could see the fire on the top of the hills in Kiotari. They said all the hotels were on fire.”\n",

      "Rhodes travel agent Stelios Kotiadis confirmed to the Associated Press that the evacuation was hasty. “There was panic. ... The authorities were overwhelmed,” he said.\n",

      "Torrential downpours caused widespread flooding across Nova Scotia on Saturday, damaging homes and infrastructure and triggering a search for four people who were missing after the vehicles they were travelling in were submerged in floodwaters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two children were among five people travelling in West Hants, N.S., when their vehicle was submerged, RCMP spokesperson Cindy Bayers said in an e-mail, adding that the three other occupants managed to escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A youth and another man are also unaccounted for after the vehicle they were travelling in was submerged, also in West Hants,” she added. Two other occupants of the vehicle were rescued, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RCMP said searches for the missing were underway, but they urged the public to stay home and not join the search “as current conditions are dangerous.” They said there were no other reports of missing or injured people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list of infrastructure damage from the flooding is “long and it will continue to grow,” said Premier Tim Houston during a news conference Saturday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We got three months’ worth of rain in less than 24 hours. It came fast, and it came furious,” Mr. Houston said. “Our climate is changing, it’s obvious around us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Municipality of the District of Lunenburg, 435 homes in the Fancy Lake area were asked to evacuate, said Mayor Carolyn Bolivar-Getson.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hundreds of people were also evacuated early Saturday morning in West Hants Regional Municipality for fear that a local dam would breach. “There was no breach, and we thank God for that,” Mayor Abraham Zebian said in an interview. “We’re just trying to get the whole situation under control right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said he had never seen that much rain fall so quickly. “It just overwhelmed all the systems: It washed out roads, it struck out bridges, it took people’s homes,” he said. “It’s a sad day for a lot of people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emergency shelters were opened for evacuees throughout the affected areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials said some places received between 200 and 300 mm of rain since Friday afternoon. Ian Hubbard, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said Halifax normally gets around 95 mm of rain for the entire month of July. What fell since Friday represents “a tremendous amount of water coming down in a very short period of time,” he said, in a province that already experienced a very wet month contrasting with the hot and dry weather that exacerbated major wildfires in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some areas could expect an additional 40 to 100 mm, Environment Canada said in an online advisory Saturday. “The tropical nature of the rainfall from this system has already significantly impacted parts of the province,” the agency said, and the ground, “already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.” Heavy precipitation was also expected on Prince Edward Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nova Scotia Public Works Minister Kim Masland said in a statement that a full assessment of the damage to provincial infrastructure would have to wait until the flood waters recede. She warned it would take time to reopen roads – several of which were closed starting Friday afternoon around Halifax – and make repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Halifax District RCMP advised motorists to stay home due to bad weather and said there have been multiple reports of local flooding on Hammonds Plains Road, Lucasville Road, Sackville Cross Road, and parts of Sackville Drive and Beaverbank Road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nova Scotia Power said in a news release that “at peak, approximately 70,000 customers lost power due to lightning impacts on power equipment and infrastructure.” More than 10,000 were still in the dark around noon on Saturday.\n",

      "Thousands more residents and tourists on three Greek islands were fleeing to safety Monday as scores of wildfires fueled by high winds and an unrelenting pattern of brutal heat waves consumed homes, hotels and businesses in the peak tourism season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities said some of the fires may have been started by arson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned that his country has \"more difficult days\" ahead because of soaring temperatures. He estimated that 32,000 \"precautionary evacuations\" were carried out over the weekend on the islands of Rhodes, Corfu and Evia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are at war against the fires,\" Mitsotakis said.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Rhodes, tourists are fleeing from the path of a weeklong fire that roared down from the mountains into several coastal areas. The Ministry of Climate Change and Civil Protection called it the nation's largest wildfire evacuation in history. Evacuations spread to Corfu, where 2,000 were ordered out Monday as the fire raged in the northeast end of the island but had not reached residences, the local fire department reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tourists were being crowded into emergency shelters in schools, airports and sports facilities. Many of the tourists are British, and Jet2 was among the U.K. airlines organizing repatriation flights to get them home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The risk of fire will be extreme in several areas of Greece today,” Fire Service spokesperson Vassilis Vathrakogiannis warned Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developments:\n",
      "\n",
      "◾ Neighboring nations were aiding the effort to control the blazes. Turkey, Croatia and Egypt were providing planes and helicopters, Greek officials said.\n",
      "\n",
      "◾ Temperatures on the southern Greek mainland soared as high as 113 degrees in recent days. An average of 50 new wildfires have ignited over the last 12 days, including 64 on Sunday, government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis said.\n",
      "\n",
      "◾ European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen contacted Mitsotakis late Sunday to offer assistance. She said climate change was partially to blame for the disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yiannis Artopios, a fire service spokesperson on Rhodes, told Greek television network Skai TV that authorities are currently questioning suspected arsonists.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fires are not sparked on their own,” he told Skai TV. “They are triggered by the human hand, be it intentionally or not. We currently have several people being questioned in connection with their probable involvement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Corfu, the region's deputy mayor for tourism and construction told the BBC the fires there were started by \"a group of people.\" Chariton Koutscouris said officials had a \"suspicion\" fires would be started this weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials are said to have been warned on Friday by the fire department chief that someone who started two fires last week would start another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was right,\" Koutscouris said, adding that the apparent arsonists \"get pleasure out of this with the pain of the other people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thousands of tourists who were forced to evacuate from the hotels on Rhodes were temporarily sheltered in gyms and schools on the island, while many had already left Monday. There has also been a \"huge wave\" of solidarity and support from the inhabitants of the island, the Athens-Macedonia News Agency reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 8,000 tourists were staying in shelters in the villages of Rhodes with the assistance of hundreds of volunteers providing food, fruit, juices, water and other staples. Some locals opened their businesses and sent as many necessities as they could; supermarkets and mini-markets also opened to serve the stranded. Some residents even offered their own homes to host those in need, the agency reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acts of kindness were interspersed with less altruistic moments amid the fear and chaos of trying to escape the fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ian Murison, a businessman from London on vacation in southern Rhodes with his wife and 12-year-old son, said there was only one bus waiting to take guests away from the flames approaching their hotel, which had a capacity for 1,200. So Murison and his family walked about 2 miles under a cloud of ash to a beach where they waited with thousands of others to be evacuated by bus or boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You could see an orange glow in the sky ... big balls of fire going into the sky,” Murison said, describing the jostling to jam into small boats arriving to take evacuees away. “It didn’t matter if you had children, adults were fighting to get on next. It was very, very stressful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mitsotakis pledged that whatever burns down will be rebuilt and those affected will be compensated. The leader of the Socialist opposition party, Nikos Androulakis, told the Athens-Macedonia News Agency the government must take responsibility for the \"immeasurable\" disaster the nation faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From the 'all are under control,' we reached the point where properties are lost and thousands of tourists (are told to) leave from the hotels, and the locals to evacuate their houses,\" Androulakis said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfires have also been breaking out in southern Italy, where temperatures have hovered above 100 degrees Fahrenheit and past the 110 mark for weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firefighters tried Monday to control a wind-fed brush fire near Palermo in Sicily and also faced several other blazes on the Mediterranean island, including near the seaside tourist resort of Cefalu. Wildfires also ignited in Calabria, including in the Aspromonte mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Italian island, Sardinia, was confronting a different set of weather-related issues. Flights from Milan, Paris and Amsterdam had to be diverted to other airports on the Mediterranean island Monday afternoon because the temperature on the tarmac at Olbia in the northeast was considered too dangerous at more than 116 degrees, RAI state TV reported.\n",

      "The smell of wood burning has long signified summertime fun, from campfires to barbecues to bonfires on the beach. But nowadays, that seasonal smell of smoke signals more of a warning: Wildfires are intensifying because of climate change. They’re growing larger, moving faster and burning at higher elevations than before. Together, these conditions cue a heightened health threat, perhaps for more people than you might think.\n",

      "“You don’t have to live in a high risk, fire-impacted area to worry about smoke exposure,” said Dr. Mary Prunicki, director of air pollution and health research at the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University. After the Camp Fire ripped across Butte County, Calif., in 2018, for instance, airborne lead spiked to dangerous levels as it traveled more than 150 miles downwind.\n",

      "['Andrea Yu'] 2023-07-25 07:00:00-04:00 THE QUESTION\n",
      "\n",
      "I worked at a retail shop. When the store was empty, my coworker and I talked about our personal lives, occasionally complaining about our boss. I later found out that my boss was recording our conversations because he fired me for talking poorly about him. I never knew he was recording this whole time and I feel extremely uncomfortable. He says he was allowed to record audio because we knew there were security cameras set up in the store. Do I have grounds to take legal action against him?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE FIRST ANSWER\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermie Abraham, employment lawyer, Advocation, Toronto\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, there are no specific statutory (for example, government-enacted) employment laws that prohibit the monitoring of employees. In Ontario, the Employment Standards Act requires certain businesses to have an electronic monitoring policy – but again, nothing prevents an Ontario employer from monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canadian common laws (for example, judge-made laws) have privacy protections that apply in employment. One such law, which could apply in your case, is the tort of Invasion of Privacy. But to be successful in this legal action, you would have to show that you had a reasonable expectation of privacy, which might be hard to prove in this case. First, it is generally acceptable for retail employers to use surveillance cameras in public areas on their premises. So, there is nothing inherently wrong with this type of monitoring. And if you were aware of this monitoring (even if you thought the monitoring was only video), it would be hard to argue that you had a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word ‘monitoring’ is all-encompassing. Monitoring can include the creation of a record, such as an audio recording, video recording, history of online searches and keystrokes, which can be archived and reviewed. Given that employers are not prohibited from monitoring under government-enacted laws, it would still default to the common law to determine if there was an invasion of privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many video recording systems also record audio. If the store surveillance system was recording both video and audio in public areas of the store, I feel there wouldn’t be an expectation of privacy. If the employer was recording his employees separate and apart from store surveillance, then depending on where the recording took place and why the employer was recording, there might be a breach of privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing to know is that most employees can lose their job at any time and for any reason, provided that the reason does not violate human rights laws (for example, firing someone because of their race, gender, religion or disability). Though your employer is legally able to fire you for talking poorly about him, he would still have to provide you with notice of termination, which cannot be less than what is required under statutory employment laws (which depending on your province, is the Employment Standards Act, Employment Standards Code, Labour Standards Act or Labour Standards Code).\n",
      "\n",
      "THE SECOND ANSWER\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonathan Dowhaluk, partner, Taylor Janis Law Group, Edmonton\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are not a party to the conversation, it is a criminal offence for you to record that conversation without the consent of the parties. It is only legal for your employer to record conversations in the workplace if there is a representative of the company present or if you have given their consent to be recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue here is whether your employer had your implied consent to record private conversations given that you were aware that there were surveillance cameras installed. The second issue is whether the employer was entitled to rely on the information learned through these recordings to terminate your employment with just cause, (which means termination without notice or pay in lieu of notice).\n",
      "\n",
      "In Alberta, employees enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy under Alberta’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) unless they explicitly waive that right through contract or otherwise. If an employer has given sufficient notice of surveillance, that notice can also remove the employee’s reasonable expectation of privacy. For example, if the employer has posted notices and signs that are easily readable, notifying employees that the area was being monitored, both through video and audio, the employer could argue that the employee had no reasonable expectation that their conversation would be private. Absent these notices to the employee, it is not likely that an employer can justify recording employee conversations and using it to justify termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all of the above considered, there is a good chance that you not only have a strong case of wrongful dismissal against your employer, but if it is demonstrated that the employer breached your privacy interests, you may also be entitled to additional damages under the PIPA.\n",

      "Article content The forecast marks a contrast to the sunny outlook offered by the CEO three months earlier, despite expectations of a shrinking economy throughout much of the year. The company is also taking steps to mitigate the fallout from extreme weather in the future, installing larger culverts, sprinklers and pumps at various sites, said chief operating officer Ed Harris. “We just can’t go through this type of disruption anymore, to be honest about it,” he said. In the quarter ended June 30, net income fell by 12 per cent to $1.17 billion from $1.33 billion a year earlier, CN reported. Revenues in its second quarter dropped seven per cent to $4.06 billion from $4.34 billion in the period a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share decreased nine per cent to $1.76 from $1.93 the year before. Analysts had expected $1.82 per share, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\n",

      "['David Wallace-Wells'] 2023-07-26 00:00:00 But whose responsibility is the carbon produced when forests burn? In the age of extreme weather and climate agreements, the world has learned to tabulate ecological guilt nation by nation — cutting responsibility for the current crisis into so many slices of pie. Wildfire emissions typically aren’t even recorded on the balance sheet of any particular country’s ledger, but according to some tabulations, in 2021 wildfires in North America and Eurasia contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any nation but China, the United States and India. And the toxic smoke from those fires increasingly travels elsewhere, too, now regularly choking the air and blotting out the sun not just in cities built into nearby wildland but also in major concrete megalopolises whole continents — or even oceans — away. Whose responsibility is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "If the 20th century taught us the perversity of aggressive fire suppression, the 21st is already teaching us the limits of that lesson. A firefighting approach based on the principle that humans and human settlements should be protected but that otherwise forests should be allowed to burn is sensible if the aim is to reduce property damage and loss of life. But if the costs to human health of wildfire smoke are larger than from the fires themselves, should the goal be recalibrated? Could it be? If the aim is to manage the health of the planet by limiting the emission of carbon from wildfire, what kind of approach does that require? Is it even possible? In California the record-setting fire season of 2020, which produced five of the state’s seven largest fires in modern history, also entirely erased its emissions gains over the previous 16 years — putting twice as much carbon into the atmosphere as was saved by all of the state’s decarbonization policies from 2003 to 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada has a gargantuan per capita carbon footprint, in fact, by some measures larger than that of the United States. But it is not itself singularly to blame for the changes unfurling in its remote forests or capable of truly controlling the new megafires that result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly this is a simple matter of scale: Canada is the world’s second-largest country, with a population roughly a quarter the size of Russia, which Americans often conceive as a vast expanse of uninhabited tundra. The 49th parallel is often thought of as Canada’s southern boundary, but half of Canadians live south of it, clustered just in the little outcropping wedge of Ontario and Quebec tucked between Michigan and Maine. All told, it’s estimated that 85 percent of Canadians live within 150 miles of the U.S.-Canada border — as though 284 million Americans lived south of Los Angeles and Tampa, with the whole rest of the country untrammeled wilderness effectively left free to burn anytime lightning struck or a match was dropped or a power line fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "But fire control is also growing harder because the fires themselves are changing. They produce such thick walls of smoke now that tanker planes sometimes can’t fly into them; they throw embers over what were once considered uncrossable fire breaks; they burn and smolder underground through winter; they get so hot that firefighters risk second-degree burns just approaching them. “The most powerful firefighting equipment that humans have — Canadair planes that cost roughly $35 million each and drop 30 bathtubs’ worth of water at a time — can extinguish fires with an intensity of up to 10,000 kilowatts per meter of fire line,” Henry Mance wrote recently in The Financial Times. “Today’s megafires are a different order of magnitude, sometimes exceeding 100,000 kilowatts per meter” — 10 times as intense. Water dumped from above can evaporate before it reaches the ground.\n"

      "\n",
      "As the threat to northern Quebec Cree communities from historic wildfires diminishes, the Cree Nation’s top firefighter is looking to a future where destructive blazes like those that have been burning for weeks become more common\n",
      "\n",
      "Millions of hectares of forest have burned in the Cree territories, at times driving thousands of people from their homes. While the flames didn’t reach any of the province’s nine Cree communities, cabins, traplines and hunting grounds have been lost, said Lee-Roy Blacksmith, the regional fire marshal for the Cree Nation Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s going to be a lot of grieving because that’s their land. They were born and raised in the land,” Blacksmith said of the hunters and trappers. “The food that they gather won’t be the same.” For some, the loss of cabins will be painful, he said in a recent interview, because of “all the memories that they built throughout those years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There will also be a financial loss for community members, Blacksmith said. For some, their cabins couldn’t be insured because they’re too old, while others have lost boats and ATVs. Many hunters had to leave so quickly they didn’t have time to properly store geese killed during the recent hunting season, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In hopes of reducing such losses in the future, Blacksmith is pushing to get more Cree trained as auxiliary forest firefighters.\n",
      "\n",
      "This month, 70 people have gone through the training – 40 from inland communities where the fires are no longer a threat and 30 from the coastal communities near where fires continue to burn. The last group finished their training last week, he said, and were scheduled to be deployed within days.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it took years to get Quebec’s forest fire prevention agency, SOPFEU, to agree to the training for his people. “We had to push them, we had to keep asking,” he said. Now he wants to expand it to ensure necessary resources are available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Josée Poitras, a spokeswoman for SOPFEU, said she didn’t know why Blacksmith’s earlier requests went unanswered. She said SOPFEU trains auxiliary firefighters in areas where it expects they’ll be needed. For example, she said, this year in the Atikamekw community of Manawan to the south, Indigenous auxiliary received training before the start of this fire season.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, she said, the collaboration with the Cree is going well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, the local crews help us a lot to fight the fires and they have the added advantage of knowing the territory they have to protect better,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfire maps 2023: Tracking fires and air quality across Canada\n",
      "\n",
      "SOPFEU reported Wednesday that 86 fires continue to burn in the province, with 69 in its “northern zone” – roughly the northern half of Quebec. Areas near James Bay, where four Cree communities are located, remain the most affected. While recent rains have slowed the progression of the fires, road access to several Cree communities on James Bay remains limited due to heavy smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blacksmith said this is the first year since 2013 – when a major fire burned near Eastmain on James Bay – that Cree communities have been directly threatened by forest fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the past, we used to have one fire at a time, SOPFEU would control it, would put it out in a quicker fashion. With this fire (season), we had several fires happening in a short period of time,” he said. “It’s a lot different than in previous years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since early June, eight Cree communities have undergone full or partial evacuations due to heavy smoke. All residents have since been allowed to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poitras described the fires in the northern zone as “historic.” This year, 128 fires in the zone have burned approximately 3.4 million hectares of forest, she said. Over the past 10 years, that part of the province has seen an average of 37 fires a year, burning an average of 208,000 hectares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poitras and Blacksmith attribute the size and number of fires in the northern zone to an extremely dry June. “That’s when we had lightning, thunderstorms that passed by and lightning was just shooting everywhere, and it ignited the territory like nothing,” Blacksmith said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sees it as a sign of a changing climate that’s slowly leading to the “different weather, different seasons we’ve been having,” he said.\n"

      "['Andrea Yu'] 2023-07-25 07:00:00-04:00 THE QUESTION\n",
      "\n",
      "I worked at a retail shop. When the store was empty, my coworker and I talked about our personal lives, occasionally complaining about our boss. I later found out that my boss was recording our conversations because he fired me for talking poorly about him. I never knew he was recording this whole time and I feel extremely uncomfortable. He says he was allowed to record audio because we knew there were security cameras set up in the store. Do I have grounds to take legal action against him?\n",
      "\n",
      "THE FIRST ANSWER\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermie Abraham, employment lawyer, Advocation, Toronto\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, there are no specific statutory (for example, government-enacted) employment laws that prohibit the monitoring of employees. In Ontario, the Employment Standards Act requires certain businesses to have an electronic monitoring policy – but again, nothing prevents an Ontario employer from monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canadian common laws (for example, judge-made laws) have privacy protections that apply in employment. One such law, which could apply in your case, is the tort of Invasion of Privacy. But to be successful in this legal action, you would have to show that you had a reasonable expectation of privacy, which might be hard to prove in this case. First, it is generally acceptable for retail employers to use surveillance cameras in public areas on their premises. So, there is nothing inherently wrong with this type of monitoring. And if you were aware of this monitoring (even if you thought the monitoring was only video), it would be hard to argue that you had a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word ‘monitoring’ is all-encompassing. Monitoring can include the creation of a record, such as an audio recording, video recording, history of online searches and keystrokes, which can be archived and reviewed. Given that employers are not prohibited from monitoring under government-enacted laws, it would still default to the common law to determine if there was an invasion of privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many video recording systems also record audio. If the store surveillance system was recording both video and audio in public areas of the store, I feel there wouldn’t be an expectation of privacy. If the employer was recording his employees separate and apart from store surveillance, then depending on where the recording took place and why the employer was recording, there might be a breach of privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing to know is that most employees can lose their job at any time and for any reason, provided that the reason does not violate human rights laws (for example, firing someone because of their race, gender, religion or disability). Though your employer is legally able to fire you for talking poorly about him, he would still have to provide you with notice of termination, which cannot be less than what is required under statutory employment laws (which depending on your province, is the Employment Standards Act, Employment Standards Code, Labour Standards Act or Labour Standards Code).\n",
      "\n",
      "THE SECOND ANSWER\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonathan Dowhaluk, partner, Taylor Janis Law Group, Edmonton\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are not a party to the conversation, it is a criminal offence for you to record that conversation without the consent of the parties. It is only legal for your employer to record conversations in the workplace if there is a representative of the company present or if you have given their consent to be recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue here is whether your employer had your implied consent to record private conversations given that you were aware that there were surveillance cameras installed. The second issue is whether the employer was entitled to rely on the information learned through these recordings to terminate your employment with just cause, (which means termination without notice or pay in lieu of notice).\n",
      "\n",
      "In Alberta, employees enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy under Alberta’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) unless they explicitly waive that right through contract or otherwise. If an employer has given sufficient notice of surveillance, that notice can also remove the employee’s reasonable expectation of privacy. For example, if the employer has posted notices and signs that are easily readable, notifying employees that the area was being monitored, both through video and audio, the employer could argue that the employee had no reasonable expectation that their conversation would be private. Absent these notices to the employee, it is not likely that an employer can justify recording employee conversations and using it to justify termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all of the above considered, there is a good chance that you not only have a strong case of wrongful dismissal against your employer, but if it is demonstrated that the employer breached your privacy interests, you may also be entitled to additional damages under the PIPA.\n",

      "\n",
      "Authorities ordered the evacuation of a handful of communities in central Greece on Wednesday as they battled new fire fronts in the country, supercharged by strong winds and heatwave temperatures exceeding 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixty-one wildfires erupted across Greece in the last 24 hours alone, the fire brigade said, with the worst outbreaks near the central town of Velestino where officials ordered precautionary evacuations of six nearby communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dozens of firefighters were battling the flames, assisted by 15 fire engines and four aircraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "A separate wildfire flared near another central town, Lamia, where residents of several settlements were also told to leave their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fires had largely died down on the Greek island of Rhodes, where more than 20,000 foreign visitors and locals fled seaside hotels and homes over the weekend. Firefighters were still trying to put out a wall of flames close to a mountainous area in Rhodes’ south, that has burned uncontrolled for more than a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The battle with the devastating fires continues on several fronts today by all Civil Protection forces in extreme conditions,” fire brigade spokesperson Ioannis Artopios said in a briefing. “Today is the most difficult day of this summer.”\n",

      "Greece is heavily reliant on its sea and sun tourist trade and Rhodes, one of its largest Aegean Islands, is among its top destinations, attracting about 1.5 million foreign visitors in the summer months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 3,000 holidaymakers had left Rhodes to return home by plane by Tuesday, while tour operators cancelled upcoming trips. TUI dropped flights to Rhodes through Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tourism Minister Olga Kefalogianni stressed that wildfires had affected only a small part of the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have contacted the chamber of hoteliers and we want to see how we can bring people with holiday vouchers back,” she told Open television.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firefighters were also tackling a blaze on the island of Evia, where two pilots were killed on Tuesday when their Canadair CL-215 plane crashed into a hillside as it was dropping water onto the flames.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burnt body of a 41-year-old stockbreeder, missing since Sunday, was found in a shack in a remote area of the island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfires in Greece are common in the summer, but hotter, drier and windier conditions, the result of a climate change, have turned the country into a Mediterranean hotspot in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, the government shut the ancient Acropolis in Athens, one of the world’s most visited tourism sites, at 11 a.m. (0800 GMT) because of the searing heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am making a plea that no worker is out on the streets today. It will be the hottest day of the summer,” Labour Minister Adonis Georgiadis posted on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Artopios, the fire brigade spokesperson, said that tackling the fires was a significant financial burden for Greece, with firefighting efforts on Rhodes alone costing about 7.5 million euros ($8.30 million) so far.\n",

      "['David Wallace-Wells'] 2023-07-26 00:00:00 But whose responsibility is the carbon produced when forests burn? In the age of extreme weather and climate agreements, the world has learned to tabulate ecological guilt nation by nation — cutting responsibility for the current crisis into so many slices of pie. Wildfire emissions typically aren’t even recorded on the balance sheet of any particular country’s ledger, but according to some tabulations, in 2021 wildfires in North America and Eurasia contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any nation but China, the United States and India. And the toxic smoke from those fires increasingly travels elsewhere, too, now regularly choking the air and blotting out the sun not just in cities built into nearby wildland but also in major concrete megalopolises whole continents — or even oceans — away. Whose responsibility is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "If the 20th century taught us the perversity of aggressive fire suppression, the 21st is already teaching us the limits of that lesson. A firefighting approach based on the principle that humans and human settlements should be protected but that otherwise forests should be allowed to burn is sensible if the aim is to reduce property damage and loss of life. But if the costs to human health of wildfire smoke are larger than from the fires themselves, should the goal be recalibrated? Could it be? If the aim is to manage the health of the planet by limiting the emission of carbon from wildfire, what kind of approach does that require? Is it even possible? In California the record-setting fire season of 2020, which produced five of the state’s seven largest fires in modern history, also entirely erased its emissions gains over the previous 16 years — putting twice as much carbon into the atmosphere as was saved by all of the state’s decarbonization policies from 2003 to 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada has a gargantuan per capita carbon footprint, in fact, by some measures larger than that of the United States. But it is not itself singularly to blame for the changes unfurling in its remote forests or capable of truly controlling the new megafires that result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly this is a simple matter of scale: Canada is the world’s second-largest country, with a population roughly a quarter the size of Russia, which Americans often conceive as a vast expanse of uninhabited tundra. The 49th parallel is often thought of as Canada’s southern boundary, but half of Canadians live south of it, clustered just in the little outcropping wedge of Ontario and Quebec tucked between Michigan and Maine. All told, it’s estimated that 85 percent of Canadians live within 150 miles of the U.S.-Canada border — as though 284 million Americans lived south of Los Angeles and Tampa, with the whole rest of the country untrammeled wilderness effectively left free to burn anytime lightning struck or a match was dropped or a power line fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "But fire control is also growing harder because the fires themselves are changing. They produce such thick walls of smoke now that tanker planes sometimes can’t fly into them; they throw embers over what were once considered uncrossable fire breaks; they burn and smolder underground through winter; they get so hot that firefighters risk second-degree burns just approaching them. “The most powerful firefighting equipment that humans have — Canadair planes that cost roughly $35 million each and drop 30 bathtubs’ worth of water at a time — can extinguish fires with an intensity of up to 10,000 kilowatts per meter of fire line,” Henry Mance wrote recently in The Financial Times. “Today’s megafires are a different order of magnitude, sometimes exceeding 100,000 kilowatts per meter” — 10 times as intense. Water dumped from above can evaporate before it reaches the ground.\n"

      "It is estimated that approximately 350 of the 2,857 vehicles on board are new Mercedes-Benzes, though it isn’t exactly clear what brands make up the remainder of the manifest. It is suggested at least 25 cars on the stricken vessel are electric, but not necessarily Mercedes EVs; and that the fire may be traced back to such a battery-powered vehicle. EV fires are notoriously difficult to extinguish, owing to the chemicals involved and the chance of thermal runaway.\n",

      "According to public records on MarineTraffic.com, the Fremantle Highway departed Bremerhaven on Germany’s North Sea coast around 5:00 pm local time yesterday. Its planned route was taking it to Port Said, an Egyptian city at the northern end of the Suez Canal, about a week’s journey. The ship was built in 2012, is just shy of 200 metres in length, and can carry about 4,000 cars in its cargo holds.\n",

      "Readers with sharp memories may recall the sinking of the Felicity Ace last year, an incident which destroyed thousands of cars from various luxury brands and actually forced Lamborghini to restart production of the final-run Aventador Ultimae in order to replace the dozen or so lost units. Almost all the vehicles on that ship were products of brands within the VW Group, including almost 200 Bentleys and about 100 Lambos. Financial wonks pegged the loss at nearly half-a-billion dollars.\n"

      "That risk has been put under the spotlight by the burning car carrier drifting off the Dutch coast.

      "While all logistics companies deal with the risk of EV lithium-ion batteries burning with twice the energy of a normal fire, the maritime industry hasn’t kept up with the developing technology and how it creates greater risk, maritime officials and insurers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were 209 ship fires reported during 2022, the highest number in a decade and 17 per cent more than in 2021, according to a report from insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS). Of that total, 13 occurred on car carriers, but how many involved EVs was not available.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Maritime Safety Agency said in a March report the main cargo types identified as responsible for “a large share of cargo fire accidents included ... lithium-ion batteries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There were 3,783 new cars on board, including 498 electric battery vehicles, a spokesperson of ship chartering company “K” Line said on Friday. Initial reports had put the number of electric vehicles at just 25.\n",

      "Japan’s Shoei Kisen, which owns the ship, said it was working with authorities to get control of the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cause of the fire, while still officially undetermined, has raised questions about “what blind spots there are when transporting electric cars powered by batteries – which when they catch fire can’t be extinguished with water, or even by oxygen deprivation,” said Nathan Habers, spokesperson for the Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners (KVNR).\n",

      "Fire extinguishing systems on the massive ships that haul cars weren’t designed for those hotter fires, and shipping companies and regulators are scrambling to catch up, said Douglas Dillon, executive director of the Tri-state Maritime Safety Association that covers Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent fire-related losses are resulting in increased insurance costs for automakers shipping cargo and costs are likely to increase for vessel owners as well, said John Frazee, a managing director at insurance broker Marsh. As ship owners seek to limit losses by legally pursuing automakers whose vehicles are determined to have caused a fire, automakers are buying additional liability protection, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exacerbating the risks is the business model used by the companies that includes tightly packed ships. Auto carriers like the burning ship are known as RoRos, which stands for roll-on/roll-off – the way cars are loaded and unloaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "RoRos are like floating parking garages and can have a dozen or more decks carrying thousands of vehicles, industry officials said. Unlike parking lots, however, cars are parked bumper-to-bumper with as little as a foot or two of space overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firemen typically put out EV battery fires on roadsides by clearing the area around the burning vehicle and flooding the underside with water, something difficult to do on a RoRo, Dillon said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no way for a firefighter in protective gear to get to the location of a fire” on a ship, he said, adding the cramped conditions increase the danger getting trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "While trains and trucks also transport EVs, isolating and extinguishing fires is easier as workers can unhook a rail car and a trucker can pull over, said Frazee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frazee expects insurers to lead the charge on strengthening safety systems on ships. Options being worked on include new chemicals to douse flames, specialized EV fire blankets, battery piercing fire hose nozzles and proposals to segregate EVs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see no quick solution,” Frazee said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Maritime Organization, which sets regulations for safety at sea, plans to evaluate new measures next year for ships transporting EVs in light of the growing number of fires on cargo ships, a spokesperson told Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "That could include specifications on types of water extinguishers available on boats and limitations on the amount a battery can be charged, which impacts flammability.\n",
      "\n",
      "With EVs here to stay, KVNR’s Habers said his group is discussing tightening regulations to account for the additional safety risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is already a whole lot of communication underway about this,” he said, “but with this incident it becomes apparent we might need to speed up the process, especially when you consider that the number of this sort of cars is only going to rise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Global auto sales last year totaled 81 million vehicles, 9.5 per cent of which were EVs, according to EV-Volumes.com. China and Europe have been the most aggressive regions in pushing automakers to shift to EVs, and U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has proposed rules that could result in as much as two-thirds of the new vehicle market shifting to EVs by 2032.\n"

      "The smell of wood burning has long signified summertime fun, from campfires to barbecues to bonfires on the beach. But nowadays, that seasonal smell of smoke signals more of a warning: Wildfires are intensifying because of climate change. They’re growing larger, moving faster and burning at higher elevations than before. Together, these conditions cue a heightened health threat, perhaps for more people than you might think.\n",

      "“You don’t have to live in a high risk, fire-impacted area to worry about smoke exposure,” said Dr. Mary Prunicki, director of air pollution and health research at the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University. After the Camp Fire ripped across Butte County, Calif., in 2018, for instance, airborne lead spiked to dangerous levels as it traveled more than 150 miles downwind.\n",

      "Wildfire smoke is responsible for about the same number of premature deaths in Canada each year as traffic pollution, researchers estimate, though they say there is a long way to go before understanding what the long-term consequences could be on people’s health.\n",

      "The only study to ever quantify such fatalities in Canada was released in July, 2020, and analyzed the health impacts of smoke from the 2013 to 2015 wildfire season and the 2017 to 2018 season. In the paper published in Science of the Total Environment, authors from Health Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) estimated that between 624 and 2,740 people would die each year from the short-term and chronic impacts of breathing in such levels of smoke. The resulting annual health care costs were calculated at anywhere from $4.7-billion to $20.8-billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "EXPLAINER: How does wildfire smoke affect air quality and your health?\n",
      "\n",
      "This summer, in which fires have already consumed more than three times the area burned than that in any one of the study’s years on average, is likely to result in an even greater number of premature deaths, according to lung specialist Christopher Carlsten. And that upward trend may continue as climate scientists anticipate an increase in wildfire frequency and severity in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The danger was underlined earlier this month when a nine-year-old boy from 100 Mile House, B.C. died from an asthma attack his parents said was exacerbated by wildfire smoke. The BCCDC issued a public safety bulletin in response and said it’s investigating the boy’s death.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while experts can predict some of the likely consequences of more regular wildfire smoke based on what they know of air pollution in general, they say they won’t understand its full impacts for several years down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the biggest unknown,” said Dr. Carlsten, the head of the University of British Columbia’s respiratory medicine division.\n",
      "\n",
      "His team at the Air Pollution Exposure Laboratory is now one of multiple research groups shifting their work from the impacts of traffic and industrial pollution to that of wildfire smoke. One question they’re interested in answering is how smoke differs from other air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "A March, 2021 study of wildfires in Southern California, published in the Nature Communications journal, found the tiny particles released in smoke were 10 times more toxic than those in regular air pollution. The particles of concern are known as particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), meaning they are 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller. An average human hair, by comparison, is around 70 microns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The danger of such microscopic particles is their ability to slip past the body’s defence systems and infiltrate a person’s airways and bloodstream, Dr. Carlsten said. When someone sucks in a breath of wildfire smoke-filled air, the sticky hair-lined inside of their nose does its best to cling onto as many particles as possible, but most of the small ones, the PM2.5, will sneak by and head deeper into the person’s airways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the particles have made it to a person’s trachea, they will encounter specialized protector cells known as macrophages. The macrophages are patrollers intended to destroy any foreign material, but they weren’t designed to deal with such an onslaught of smoke particles, and the PM2.5 will overwhelm the cells, Dr. Carlsten said. From there, the smoke particles will be free to cling to the sides of a person’s airways and lungs and even make their way into the person’s bloodstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Widespread inflammation ensues, Dr. Carlsten said. This is particularly dangerous for people with respiratory diseases, heart or lung conditions, and cancer or diabetes. Elderly people, young children and pregnant people are also at a higher risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken together, Dr. Carlsten said, a large proportion of the population is especially vulnerable to wildfire smoke: “We know there’s a massive public-health problem, but it can be quantitatively overwhelming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And beyond determining the danger of wildfire smoke, there’s the challenge of protecting people from it. It’s possible to impose regulations on pollution sources such as industrial activities and traffic, but far more difficult to do so on fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wildfire smoke is a different beast,” said Carlyn Matz, a senior air quality evaluator at Health Canada and one of the authors of the study on premature deaths.\n",

      "Kerri Johannson, a pulmonologist and professor at the University of Calgary’s school of medicine, said lung specialists normally advise people to avoid breathing in anything but clean air, but that becomes unrealistic when wildfire smoke persists for weeks on end. There are steps individuals can take, such as staying indoors and masking when outside, but Dr. Johannson said the only long-term solution she sees is getting on top of wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are policy-level decisions about land management that need to be prioritized in our country, because every person living here is potentially at risk for all the consequences of this,” she said.\n",

      "Japan’s Shoei Kisen, which owns the ship, said it was working with authorities to get control of the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cause of the fire, while still officially undetermined, has raised questions about “what blind spots there are when transporting electric cars powered by batteries – which when they catch fire can’t be extinguished with water, or even by oxygen deprivation,” said Nathan Habers, spokesperson for the Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners (KVNR).\n",

      "Fire extinguishing systems on the massive ships that haul cars weren’t designed for those hotter fires, and shipping companies and regulators are scrambling to catch up, said Douglas Dillon, executive director of the Tri-state Maritime Safety Association that covers Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent fire-related losses are resulting in increased insurance costs for automakers shipping cargo and costs are likely to increase for vessel owners as well, said John Frazee, a managing director at insurance broker Marsh. As ship owners seek to limit losses by legally pursuing automakers whose vehicles are determined to have caused a fire, automakers are buying additional liability protection, he said.\n",

      "Exacerbating the risks is the business model used by the companies that includes tightly packed ships. Auto carriers like the burning ship are known as RoRos, which stands for roll-on/roll-off – the way cars are loaded and unloaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "RoRos are like floating parking garages and can have a dozen or more decks carrying thousands of vehicles, industry officials said. Unlike parking lots, however, cars are parked bumper-to-bumper with as little as a foot or two of space overhead.\n",

      "This summer, in which fires have already consumed more than three times the area burned than that in any one of the study’s years on average, is likely to result in an even greater number of premature deaths, according to lung specialist Christopher Carlsten. And that upward trend may continue as climate scientists anticipate an increase in wildfire frequency and severity in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The danger was underlined earlier this month when a nine-year-old boy from 100 Mile House, B.C. died from an asthma attack his parents said was exacerbated by wildfire smoke. The BCCDC issued a public safety bulletin in response and said it’s investigating the boy’s death.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while experts can predict some of the likely consequences of more regular wildfire smoke based on what they know of air pollution in general, they say they won’t understand its full impacts for several years down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the biggest unknown,” said Dr. Carlsten, the head of the University of British Columbia’s respiratory medicine division.\n",
      "\n",
      "His team at the Air Pollution Exposure Laboratory is now one of multiple research groups shifting their work from the impacts of traffic and industrial pollution to that of wildfire smoke. One question they’re interested in answering is how smoke differs from other air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "A March, 2021 study of wildfires in Southern California, published in the Nature Communications journal, found the tiny particles released in smoke were 10 times more toxic than those in regular air pollution. The particles of concern are known as particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), meaning they are 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller. An average human hair, by comparison, is around 70 microns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The danger of such microscopic particles is their ability to slip past the body’s defence systems and infiltrate a person’s airways and bloodstream, Dr. Carlsten said. When someone sucks in a breath of wildfire smoke-filled air, the sticky hair-lined inside of their nose does its best to cling onto as many particles as possible, but most of the small ones, the PM2.5, will sneak by and head deeper into the person’s airways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the particles have made it to a person’s trachea, they will encounter specialized protector cells known as macrophages. The macrophages are patrollers intended to destroy any foreign material, but they weren’t designed to deal with such an onslaught of smoke particles, and the PM2.5 will overwhelm the cells, Dr. Carlsten said. From there, the smoke particles will be free to cling to the sides of a person’s airways and lungs and even make their way into the person’s bloodstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Widespread inflammation ensues, Dr. Carlsten said. This is particularly dangerous for people with respiratory diseases, heart or lung conditions, and cancer or diabetes. Elderly people, young children and pregnant people are also at a higher risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken together, Dr. Carlsten said, a large proportion of the population is especially vulnerable to wildfire smoke: “We know there’s a massive public-health problem, but it can be quantitatively overwhelming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And beyond determining the danger of wildfire smoke, there’s the challenge of protecting people from it. It’s possible to impose regulations on pollution sources such as industrial activities and traffic, but far more difficult to do so on fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wildfire smoke is a different beast,” said Carlyn Matz, a senior air quality evaluator at Health Canada and one of the authors of the study on premature deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "OPINION: Canada’s wildfire approach needs to shift from reactive to proactive\n",
      "\n",
      "THE DECIBEL: The people most affected by wildfire smoke\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerri Johannson, a pulmonologist and professor at the University of Calgary’s school of medicine, said lung specialists normally advise people to avoid breathing in anything but clean air, but that becomes unrealistic when wildfire smoke persists for weeks on end. There are steps individuals can take, such as staying indoors and masking when outside, but Dr. Johannson said the only long-term solution she sees is getting on top of wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are policy-level decisions about land management that need to be prioritized in our country, because every person living here is potentially at risk for all the consequences of this,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Johannson said it’s always a challenge to convince people to take action before they can see the true impacts of something, but that waiting another 10 or 20 years to see the cumulative effects of regularly breathing in wildfire smoke would be a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We may not be seeing it immediately now, but the potential long-term consequences are substantial.”\n"
